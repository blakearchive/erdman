time coming.  No English poet has had such absolute control over the formal
appearance of his own work, lettering, illustrating, printing, and finishing
it in color with his own hands and usually with a particular customer in mind;
yet few have had such ill fortune with their work's subsequent publication.
 Blake's nineteenth-century editors were poets or poetasters with their own
ideas of poetic diction and structure. Rossetti thought nothing of rounding
out stanzas, remaking lines and titles, dressing Blake's naked beauty in Victorian
garb. Swinburne guessed his way through difficult passages or made the implicit
explicit--as when he <quote>“improved”</quote> the lyric called
 <title level="a">“Soft Snow”</title> by changing <quote>“in
a snowy day/I askd”</quote> to <quote>“on a sunny day/I wooed”</quote>.  Ellis and Yeats substituted, for example, <quote>“shadowy
tears”</quote> for <quote>“shuddering fears”</quote>, and
the latter thought it better to <quote>“throw the dust against the wind”</quote> than <quote>“the sand”</quote>—and so on.</p><p>     Rigorous editorial standards were finally applied, to the shorter
poems, by the librarian John Sampson in 1905, who manfully cleared away the
rubbish and many of the misreadings of <quote>“all editions”</quote>
but had only indirect access to the manuscripts; and to the prophetic books
in 1926, by Professors Sloss and Wallis.  Sir Geoffrey Keynes's text of the
poetry and prose, in successively revised editions from 1925 to 1957 and in
volumes with and without <quote>“all the variant readings”</quote>,
established a still more accurate and more thorough text; and under his guidance
the Blake Trust has issued superb facsimile volumes.  Blake's designs (and
words) have, as he wished, remained unchanged <quote>“above Times troubled
fountains”</quote>— and the Public is at last getting to see them.
</p><p>The goal of the present edition is a text as close as possible to Blake's
own, even in punctuation, and with his final or preferred readings separated
from earlier or deleted or alternative readings or arrangements. (When Blake's
deletions have left gaps in the text, however, the deleted words have been
restored, in italics within square brackets.) Editing the works that Blake
etched and printed himself, but sometimes partially effaced and sometimes
rearranged, requires precise transcription but also a recognition of Blake's
own scribal errors and of the nature and limitations of his method.  For the
few works that survive only in conventional typography the editor's task is
chiefly to correct, of course within brackets, printer's errors that range
from the patent to the hypothetical.  For the many poems surviving only in
manuscript it is a matter of retracing as exactly as possible the successive
stages of composition and revision and rearrangement, especially when no final
or perfect draft is plainly discernible.</p><p>For this 1981 edition, several pairs of eyes reading proofs against
originals, photocopies, and facsimiles, have considerably increased the accuracy
of transcription.</p><div2 page="786" type="section" id="z1.1"><head rend="center">  THE PUNCTUATION</head><p>     A concise presentation of Blake's printed punctuation for the works
in illuminated printing must acknowledge the frequent alternations introduced
when he finished the designs with brush and pens.  But when the sequence of
issue of copies can be determined, it appears that such variations in punctuation
were often not confirmed in subsequent copies.  Thus they do not indicate
that Blake consistently intended to alter the punctuation from that in the
printed texts<pb n="787"/> before they were retouched.  For a collected edition—as
against transcripts of individual copies—the printed punctuation thus
appears to offer the best evidence of Blake's intentions.</p><p>     The hazards of the present editorial choice of Blake's own punctuation
are minimal with respect to the lyric poems, of short lines and firm stanzas,
for here an editor's patching could mislead the reader more than omitted stopping.
 But the <quote>“long resounding”</quote> lines of Blake's epics
and prophecies confront us with a problem to which there is no true parallel.
 When Blake omits nearly all punctuation, as he does in most manuscript pages
and intermittently in etched ones, so much effort is required merely to follow
the prose sense, the syntax, of some passages that all of us are grateful
for the <quote>“bold attempt made”</quote> by Sir Geoffrey Keynes,
with the help of Max Plowman, <quote>“to supply punctuation, with the
admitted risk of sometimes conveying a meaning not intended by Blake”</quote> (Keynes 1957, p xiii).</p><p>     Unhappily, to supply punctuation means also to remove or change some
of the punctuation found.  It means moving Blake's question marks to the ends
of clauses, imposing a modern consistency on his semicolons and periods, adding
apostrophes where his possessives are truly ambiguous in number.  Blake is
not steady about punctuation, but when he does attend to it he does so in
the eighteenth-century rhetorical fashion: a dramatic passage is studded with
what the modern journalist calls shriek-marks but which then served, <hi rend="i">
within the line</hi>, as italics do, for emphasis not pause. (In modern convention,
Keats's line would be printed <quote>“Already with <hi rend="i">thee
</hi> tender is the night”</quote>.)  A solemn passage in Blake is retarded,
not halted, by strings of colons, or a slighter pausing is suggested by small
dots after members of a series of nouns or adjectives (where we would expect
commas).  Often the dot is placed in some caesural point in the line but not
according to the grammar of clauses or phrases.  Good advice to the reader
would be to study some of these careful passages (many occur in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title>) and attend to Blake's differentiation of the <quote>“terrific”</quote> parts from the <quote>“mild &amp; gentle”</quote> and the <quote>“prosaic”</quote> (see <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title>, Plate 3) even where he has not troubled to
supply any mechanical guidance for the <quote>“true Orator”</quote>
who was called upon to <quote>“chaunt”</quote> his <quote>“heroic
Verse”</quote>.  Punctuation calculated to measure out the syntax of
rational statement will almost inevitably divert both editor and reader from
the oratorical variety and musical impetus of the poet's authentic voice,
only to impose the bondage of <quote>“a Monotonous Cadence”</quote>
from which he strove to be free.</p><p>     In print it is impossible to copy Blake exactly: his colons and shriek-marks
grade into each other; he compounds a comma with a question mark; his commas
with unmistakable tails thin down to unmistakable periods.  Moreover, one
printing from his etched plate may be more lightly inked than another and
miss out some apostrophes or reduce some commas to periods, some semicolons
to colons or to commas or periods; when copies of the same plate vary, from
differences of inking, the largest mark has been selected as closest to the
mark in the copper.  In Blake the practical difference between comma and period,
however, is almost unappreciable, and I have been inclined, especially in
prose passages, to read commas or periods according to the contextual expectations
(in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi></title>, for
example). In some texts a few marks have been inserted, within square brackets.
 Only one kind of <hi rend="i">silent</hi> insertion has been practised, where
brackets would be awkward: Blake nearly always supplied the apostrophe in
the possessive of Los (<quote>“Los's”</quote>, otherwise subject
to confusion with <quote>“Loss”</quote>), and I have done so even
where he did not.</p><p>The aim, in short, has been to produce a text which will mediate between
the reader and the manuscript or Illuminated Printing without introducing
a different pointing system.  In revising for the 1981 edition, I have produced
a sprinkling of corrections of punctuation, aided by many second looks and
the sharp eyes of other scholars.  I have also reduced the punctuation supplied
within brackets to a lower minimum.</p><!-- /div2 --></div2><!-- div2 --><div2 page="787" type="section" id="z1.2"><head rend="center">POEMS FROM MANUSCRIPT</head><p>     The poetical works that were never printed by or for Blake but survive
in manuscript range from incomplete fragments and abandoned drafts (<title level="m"><hi rend="i">Tiriel</hi></title> being the most extensive of these)
to perfected lyrics that awaited only a place to be put among his illuminated
works (for example, some of the lyrics and ballads in <title level="a">“The

THE WORKS IN ILLUMINATED PRINTING</head><note id="tn1.1"/><p>     For black and white reproductions and plate by plate commentary, see
David V. Erdman, <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Illuminated Blake</hi></title>
(Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press, Doubleday &amp; Company; London: Oxford
University Press; 1974, 3rd printing 1978).</p><p>     There is much to be said for the conclusion, urged by Northrop Frye
in his <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Fearful Symmetry</hi></title>, that those
writings which Blake illustrated and issued in the form of relief etchings
which he called Illuminated Printing <quote>“were intended to form an
exclusive and definitive canon”</quote>.  Yet <quote>“exclusive”</quote> and <quote>“definitive”</quote> both need qualification.
 The disarray of the extant early tractates may signify that the author did
not wish to preserve them as units, while it would be a serious mistake on
the other hand to assume that Blake intended to exclude the lyrics of <title level="a">“The Pickering Manuscript”</title> since he did not
illustrate them or to abandon <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas
</hi></title> because he never etched it. Etching, however, did establish
a text that was definitive in the sense of fixed.  Once he had applied words
to copper and etched surrounding surfaces away, Blake could not alter a letter
except by laborious mending; he could scratch away words and even lines but
could not easily add new ones.  He called his plates <quote>“stereotypes”</quote> because on each he had made a piece of copper text and illustration
into a single solid for printing (and subsequent coloring).</p><p>     Blake was understandably reluctant to cancel whole plates, but that
does not mean he regarded the making of a set of plates as the definitive
completion of his poem; few of his <quote>“canonical”</quote>
works lack indications of the addition or removal of one or more plates. 
With a more ductile medium he might well have forged a more perfect and more
truly definitive canon.  Yet he managed to make a virtue of the patchwork
effects of his patching: a gallery of plates does not trap the observer as
might a serpentine closed circle of <quote>“fair copy”</quote>.
 Windows are left for the imagination, which may also leap from words to illustrations
and back as one series supplements the other.  Blake sometimes composed in
units of one or two plates; if he had done so more often his shifting about
of plates might have left fewer derailed paragraphs in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title>—but
he might then have done even more shifting.  Perhaps if he had been able to
make it so, each new copy of each of his works might have been in text as
well as coloring a new edition.</p><p>     He accepted the monolithic character of his pages, but he employed
every remaining means to keep his poems in motion—varying the color
of his inks and his translucent and opaque tints and washes, and varying the
sequence of his plates. It may not have been his particular consideration
to make each copy of his <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs</hi></title>
or of each of his Prophecies a unique work of art, although in effect that
is what he did, but he was obviously pleased to make every plate of every
work a vehicle of fresh vision each time he touched it.</p><div3 page="789" type="section" id="z1.6.1"><head rend="center">ALL RELIGIONS are ONE</head><head rend="center">THERE is NO NATURAL RELIGION [a, b]</head><note id="tn1.2"/><p>     The titles and 26 (once 27) paragraphs of the axioms here grouped
into three series were printed from tiny etched plates (averaging about 2
X 2 1/2 inches).  Each paragraph is on a separate plate, except that one plate
holds both <quote>“Principle 7th”</quote> and the paragraph that
follows.  In no known copies (14 sets consisting of from 8 to 14 plates) is
the grouping of axioms complete or consistent, and the evidence for Blake's
own arrangement of these subsequently scattered plates was not recognized
until 1971, when Geoffrey Keynes in his notes for the Blake Trust facsimiles
of the <title level="a">“No Natural Religion”</title> series established
the authenticity of the order adopted here.  The editorial arrangement hitherto
accepted had placed the <quote>“Conclusion”</quote> in the <quote>“a”</quote> series rather than the <quote>“b”</quote>
and had treated <title level="m"><hi rend="i">All Religions are One</hi></title>
as later than these despite its greater technical imperfection.  That the <quote>“Conclusion”</quote> belongs before the <quote>“Application”</quote> has been pointed out by John Grant. (One cannot apply a conclusion

may overlap <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell
</hi></title> (in date of etching) and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Visions

Oxford: Clarendon Press 1926, II 267) suggest <quote>“a slightly later
date”</quote> for <quote>“Thel's Motto”</quote> and Plate
6 (the conclusion).  A changed style of script  in these two plates shows
them to have been etched no earlier than 1791—plate 6 presumably replacing
an earlier version, the Motto perhaps an afterthought.  Not much can be deduced
from a composition study for an abandoned arrangement of Chapter III, on a
sheet reproduced in David Bindman's <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Blake as
an Artist</hi></title> (New York: Phaidon Press/E.  P. Dutton 1977, pl 52
and p 63). Here the chapter is introduced with the design that now closes
it (Thel observing the matron Clay and infant Worm) and is concluded with <quote>“an otherwise unknown motif of Clay calling Thel into her house, drawn
as a bulky primitive-classical hut, with `moans' flying above, in illustration”</quote> (notes Bindman) of lines 5:14-16. The final treatment of Chapter
III (introducing the Cloud with Thel at the beginning) does not depart from
the sort of symbolism used in the abandoned design.  The extant design in
Chapter IV (Plate 6) does indeed.</p><note id="tn3.2"><p>1:1 Mne Seraphim] <hi rend="i">sic, without question</hi>

of 1793, appear not to have been issued except in combination or to complement
earlier copies of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi></title>.
 The latter he continued to issue separately, feeling perhaps that they could
stand alone but that the songs of Experience required to be heard as counterpoint
in the progression of contraries.</p><p>     Ms drafts of three Innocence
songs (in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">An Island in the Moon</hi></title>)
and of 18 Experience songs (in the Notebook) are analyzed for all variants,
in the following notes.  All etched copies are identical in text, except for
Blake's tampering with line 12 of <title level="a">“The Tyger”
</title> in one copy, changing <quote>“sung”</quote> to <quote>“sang”</quote> in <title level="a">“The Clod &amp; the Pebble”
</title> in another, and altering the <quote>“smiles”</quote>
in <title level="a">“A Cradle Song”</title> in another.  In no
two copies of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Innocence</hi></title>, however,
are the plates containing the songs arranged in exactly the same order.  In
copies of the combined volume, Blake after 19 differing arrangements (in what
order we are not sure, since the dating of many copies is conjectural) settled
down to that adopted in the present edition.  In seven of the last eight copies
printed he followed this sequence; yet since two of these printings were made
not before 1815 and five not before <pb n="791"/>                         
         1825-26, i.e.e, in Blake's closing years, this <quote>“final”</quote> order may represent only a final wearniness.  For when he took pains
to write out instructions as to <quote>“The Order in which the Songs
. . . ought to be paged &amp; placed”</quote>—an order followed
in one copy, on 1818 paper, though the list is checked over twice as if for
two bindings—Blake contrived yet one more unique arrangement.  (See
Letter 68.)</p><p>It is suggested that the reader experiment, as Blake
did, to find what different tensions and resonances are produced by different
juxtapositions.</p><p><hi rend="i">Dates</hi>: 1784-1803, approximately.
 Three songs appear in the ms of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">An Island</hi></title>
(1784-85).  The earliest copies of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of
Innocence</hi></title> are complete and bear the etched date <quote>“1789”</quote> but may not have been issued that soon.  The lettering of the Innocence
songs is an improvement upon the stiff roman style of the earlier tractates,
but it continues the backward slant which was probably caused at first by
Blake's using a mirror to guide his hand when writing directly on the copper.
 An exception is <title level="a">“The Voice of the Ancient Bard”
</title> (later moved to the <title level="m"><hi rend="m">Songs of Experience
</hi></title>), which is inscribed in a transitional cursive italic, with
forward slant, a style also found in plates 1-5 of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
The Book of Thel</hi></title>.  The lettering style that became Blake's final
choice appears first in plate 6 of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Thel</hi></title>
and in all the Experience songs except those carried over from Innocence.
 In its first form it employs a lower-case <quote>“g”</quote>
with its topknot or serif switched to the left side.  Its second form employs
a conventional <quote>“g”</quote> with serif on the right and
appears in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title>, dated <quote>“1804”</quote> and all later etched works. (The hypothesis long
accepted that Blake applied the text of his Illuminated Works to the copper
by some method of transfer or counterproofing—a theory that, however,
could not account for the text of the Books of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Ahania</hi></title> and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Los</hi></title> which
are in intaglio etching—has now been conclusively overthrown by Robert
N. Essick in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">William Blake Printmaker</hi></title>,
Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press 1980, pp 89-91.)</p><p>    Four
of the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi></title> first
appeared among the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence</hi></title>: <title level="a">“The Little Girl Lost”</title> and <title level="a">
“The Little Girl Found”</title>, <title level="a">“The School
Boy”</title>, and <title level="a">“The Voice of the Ancient Bard”
</title>. Thus even while making his <quote>“1789”</quote> collection
Blake was accumulating contrary songs, including  perhaps some not fit even
temporarily for Innocence.  Of the 18 songs of Experience in Blake's Notebook
(in entries made between 1790 and late 1792) 12 seem fair copies of earlier
drafts (though subsequently revised or expanded) and only six were unmistakably
begun and composed in the Notebook, i.e., within these dates: <title level="a">

 First Blake changed the singular <quote>“Priest”</quote> and
associated pronouns and <quote>“serpent”</quote> to plural, <quote>“many a Priest”</quote> and <quote>“Priests”</quote>
with plural pronouns and <quote>“serpents”</quote>: the Priests
embraced the youth's blossoms and he <quote>“smote them”</quote>;
during this revision the sixth and seventh stanzas (lines 23-30) were consolidated.
 Meanwhile on p 111 Blake had begun some stanzas of a youth bound beneath
a mirtle—an impulse combining the mirtle and blossoms Of p 113 with
the theme of love bound, in <title level="a">“Earths Answer”</title>
(just above on p 111 written before this return to the mirtle theme):</p><lg><l>To a lovely mirtle bound</l><l>Blossoms showring all around</l><l>O how sick &amp; weary I</l><l>Underneath my mirtle lie</l></lg><p>He then canceled the first of these two couplets and added another
at the bottom for a stanza ending instead of beginning with <quote>“bound”</quote>:</p><lg><l>Like to dung upon the ground</l></lg><pb n="798"/><p>In the next column on p 111 he wrote a stanza to precede
this and two to follow it, numbering the first <quote>“1”</quote>,
the <quote>“bound”</quote> stanza <quote>“2”</quote>,
and the first of the next two <quote>“3”</quote> to show the sequence:
</p><lg><l>1 Why should I be bound to thee</l><l>O my lovely mirtle tree</l><l>Love free love cannot be bound</l><l>To any tree that grows on ground</l></lg><lg><l>2 O how sick &amp; weary I</l><l>Underneath my mirtle lie</l><l>Like to dung upon the ground</l><l>Underneath my mirtle bound</l></lg><lg><l>3 Oft my mirtle sighd in vain</l><l>To behold my heavy chain</l><l>Oft the priest beheld us sigh</l><l>And laughd at our simplicity</l></lg><lg><l>So I smote him &amp; his gore</l><l>Staind the roots my mirtle bore</l><l>But the time of youth is fled</l><l>And grey hairs are on my head</l></lg><p>The fourth stanza is not an afterthought but a return to the original
concluding stanza (lines 31-34) Of p 113, demonstrating the four stanzas on
p 111 to be an alternative route to the same finale—in effect replacing
the priest and serpent stanzas (lines 23-30).  Before confirming this alternative,
however, Blake turned from the motifs of p 111—in which the priest laughs
at the simplicity of wedlock (youth bound to mirtle tree)—to pluralize
the priest and serpent Of p 113.  Not content with the result, he then bypassed
the priests and serpents of lines 27-34 (as numbered below), and, drawing
again upon <title level="a">“Earths Answer”</title>, from which
he deleted the cruel <quote>“father of men”</quote>, he put <quote>“my father”</quote> in the priest's place (on p 111 changing <quote>“the priest beheld”</quote> to <quote>“my father saw”</quote> and on p 113 changing <quote>“Priest”</quote> or <quote>“many a Priest”</quote> (line 23) to <quote>“My father then”</quote>.  He changed line 26 to introduce the bondage motif—<quote>“And bound me in a mirtle shade”</quote>—and he inserted
the concluding phrase <quote>“in a mirtle shade”</quote> as a
catch-phrase above stanza <quote>“1”</quote> on p 111, with the
effect of canceling the remainder of p 113 (lines 23-30).</p><p>     The indicated
fusion was not carried further (<quote>“their hands”</quote> in
revised line 24 should have been changed back to <quote>“his hands”</quote>). When selecting the first two stanzas to be etched in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of Experience</hi></title> as <title level="a">“Infant
Sorrow”</title> (his inserted title), he struck through all the other
verses on pp 113 and 111.</p><p>    Editorial rescue work can salvage from
the transitional drafts of pp 113 and 111 a compact cycle-poem (compare <title level="a">“The Mental Traveller”</title>) from infancy to grey
hairs.  Keynes (pp 889-890) presents Max Plowman's <quote>“fair copy”</quote> of the fusion of the two pages before removal of the <title level="a">
“Infant Sorrow”</title> stanzas—though the resultant poem
should probably not bear that title.  Plowman had noticed the catch-word function
of the phrase <quote>“in a mirtle shade”</quote>, but his reconstruction
of the sequence of the writing on page 111 was unsound, and, like Keynes,
I treated the phrase as a title, neglecting the possibility that the catch-word
idea might be in itself valid.  Donald K. Moore has helped me to arrive at
the present interpretation of these Notebook pages (see <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Notebook</hi></title> pp 67-69).</p><p>     A variant of the Plowman <quote>“fair copy”</quote> would consist of the two unchanged <title level="a">“Infant Sorrow”</title> stanzas, followed by the inserted
third stanza as revised (lines 9-12 below), followed by the penultimate version
Of lines 23-26 and the final revisions of bypassed stanzas on p 113 (lines
31-35 ff).</p><p>The process of revision of p 113 (after the first two
stanzas) may be shown in composite form:</p><lg><l>When I saw that rage was vain</l><l>  And to su<del>[<hi rend="i">c</hi>]</del><add>&lt;l&gt;</add>k would nothing

</hi></title> 21 (1972) 17-18.</p><p>Blake evidently committed this work
to copper in haste, then deleted and mended words and lines (mostly on the
paper, not the copper) and added and removed plates.  There is only one possible
arrangement of the text, since it is organized into numbered chapters—except
that Plate 8, duplicating the numbers of Plate 10, may have been meant to
replace it (see below).  Yet Plate 2 is out of order in copy E, 15 follows
18 in A, and 8 follows rather than precedes 10 in copies B and F.</p><p>The ten pictorial plates are in different positions in each copy.  Most
of them more or less obviously relate to one or more passages in the text,
however, and if we assume that the further the pictures have shifted away
from their simplest textual referents the later the publication, we obtain
the sequence of copies CB F D E A    G, with A the climactic exemplar of the
original series (it is not later than 1800 if the provenance is correct) and
G (watermark date 1818) following at a distance. For instance, the picture
of Urizen in manacles, appropriate to the text of Plate 13 (or 8 or 10), follow,
13 in C and precedes it in B; in the more sophisticated A it is moved to the
front, as a portent of the end in the beginning.  Copy G imitates the majority
of the earlier copies, with a few slight movements further away from juxtaposition
of picture and text but without the expression of dramatic intensities found
in A.</p><p>     Other evidence only partially supports this hypothetic sequence.
 Copy C, lacking the added Plates 7-8, may be the earliest copy; A and G,
in which <quote>“First”</quote> is deleted in titles and colophon,
are probably (G certainly) the latest.  Retouched letters in D and A are in
the style of Blake's middle period (1791-1803).  Copy B may be the first to
contain Plates 7-8, since it contains an attempt to cope with the intrusion
of two Fourth Chapters which is abandoned as futile.  Seven leaves of B and
one of D have the only dated watermark (<quote>“1794”</quote>)
except G. Yet the fact that Plate 16 appears only in copies ABG seems to mark
it as a late insertion, hence to imply the sequence C FDE BA G.</p><p>   
 It should be noted that the page format and lettering of 7-8 differ markedly
from those of the other pages but are like those of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Ahania</hi></title> and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Los</hi></title>, the
second and third <quote>“BOOKS”</quote> of the series, dated <quote>“1795”</quote>.  Although Blake did not entitle these the second
and third books of Urizen, he must have considered them so for some time.
 In Copy B the numeral in the heading <quote>“1 Urizen”</quote>
is emphasized by retouching; this numeral and <quote>“First”</quote>
are deleted only in copies A and G (and even in these not thoroughly). (The <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Census</hi></title> lettering of copies does not claim
to indicate their order of publication, except for G.)</p><p>(N.B. Arrangement
of plates is confirmed by Blake's folio numbering in B D G; erased numbers

of creation from a crew of <quote>“sins”</quote> or <quote>“armies”</quote> to the single god, Urizen, and renders the word <quote>“combining”</quote> in 5:21 meaningless.  The capitalized pronoun in copy A may only

in the previous <quote>“three years composed an immense number of verses”</quote> descriptive of his <quote>“Spiritual Acts”</quote> during
those years—an account that fits <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton

only await divine assistance to <quote>“be progressively Printed &amp;

the <quote>“1804”</quote> titles mark a division of the Grand
Poem into two, a large epic and a small. Yet probably only the title pages,
if even they, were etched at that time.  After his <quote>“1795”</quote> prophecies Blake may not have resumed his Illuminated Printing until
after his 1809 Exhibition of paintings.  In a letter of December 1808 he explains
that he has <quote>“long been turned out of”</quote> his <quote>“former pursuits of printing”</quote> (he has been asked what
etched books he has for sale) and that he will be preoccupied with painting
and designing for some time to come.  In the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Descriptive Catalogue</hi></title> (section V) he repeats the hope for divine
aid to <quote>“publish”</quote> what he has <quote>“written”</quote> and seems to refer to <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title>
or <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi></title> or both, a <quote>“voluminous”</quote> work.  The first epic be began to print and
ornament, however, was the smaller and more economically designed <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> (on exact halves of the plates of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title> but inscribed so compactly as to contain nearly
as maily words per page).  Only <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title>
fits his description of <quote>“a Poem . . . which I will soon Publish”</quote> in the ms <title level="a">“Public Address”</title> of
1810 or later (see p 561).  His confident wording implies that the work was
nearly finished, and the etching of all but three of the extant plates appears
to have been done over a fairly short period: I suggest the years 1809-10.
 Although the paper of copies A and B is watermarked 1808, he cannot have
used it in that year (considering his December statement) nor until the Exhibition
was launched in the following spring.</p><p>    When he etched <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> he was content to write <quote>“Finis”</quote> on the 45th plate and in his first two <quote>“2”</quote>.
 Later, perhaps as he saw  copies to reduce the <quote>“12 Books”</quote> of his title page to <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title>
shaping into 100 plates, he went on to make <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Milton</hi></title> an even 50. Most of the plates added in copies C and D
appear to be filled with matter previously by-passed but to have been etched
in the same period as the rest of the work.  Two exceptions are extra pages
10 and 32, in a much lighter, freer style of lettering (with extra page 3
leaning toward italic).  These I suspect to have been etched later than the
rest, with copies C and D both completed near the time of printing of D (on
1815 paper).  And in these late copies Blake, though keeping to two Books,
was proud to commemorate his original plan; not only did he let the numeral
print clearly <quote>“12”</quote>, he used careful stipple work
to strengthen the shadow emphasizing each digit.  Students often suggest an
explanation: that Blake is comparing his work to Milton's 12 books of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Paradise Lost.</hi></title></p><p>     What relation
the extant <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> bears to the
poem first described in 1803 we cannot tell.  Many passages appear to be of
relatively late composition (Plates 6 and 4, for example); at least two, the
Preface and Plate 19 (see note) belong in allusions and tone to the 1807-9
period.  Yet the first added plate (3) is a refurbished passage from the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Book of Urizen</hi></title> of 1794; the last added<pb n="807"/> plate (5) reads like a remnant of a version in which <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> had some of the character of such historical
prophecies as <title level="m"><hi rend="i">America;</hi></title> and two
other added plates (10 and 16) seem early in relation to the main body of
the poem.  For an exemplification of the accretive growth of the work, see

link, <quote>“woven by Enitharmons Looms”</quote>, which was then
deleted from 6:35-7:1 (see below).  After Plate 3 Blake then inserted another
new page, Plate 4 (syntactical link between 4 and 6: Blake's neighborhood
resounded with engraving of animals [for the Hayley ballads], displaying naked
beauty and song, from Golgonooza in immense labours, ever building ever falling).
 Finally he brought in Plate 5—an earlier and perhaps rejected passage
also dealing with the creation of the classes.  The links now are difficult
but can be found.  If we recognize Palamabron with fiery harrow (5:1) as a
Felpham variant of Blake-Los busy etching, his <quote>“returning From
breathing fields”</quote> can be taken as loosely in apposition to the <quote>“Mocking”</quote> and <quote>“Displaying”</quote>
in 4:27-28.  And near the end of Plate 5, if we make a long parenthesis of <quote>“Charles . . . Living Proportion”</quote>, we may read: <quote>“Creating the Three Classes . . . From Golgonooza . . .”</quote>.
</p><p>     To recover the narrative sequence from these accretions, Northrop
Frye suggests reading the plates in the order 2, 7, 4, 6, 3, 8 (skipping 5).
 This is a useful suggestion—but does not represent (as Frye supposes) <quote>“the order of the `C' copy”</quote>.  In that copy Blake's numbering
of folios gives the present order: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. (Pages 2 and 3 are reversed
by a binder's mistake, but the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Census</hi></title>
is simply wrong in reporting an order of 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, 8.)</p></note><note id="tn96.3"><p>Plate 3 added in copies CD.</p></note><note id="tn97.1"><p>Plate 4 added in CD.</p></note><note id="tn98.1"><p>Plate 5 added in D.</p></note><note id="tn99.1"><p>6:12 Theotorm] Doubtless an error for <quote>“Theotormon”</quote></p></note><note id="tn100.1"><p>6:35 Hammer.

copies H, I, J posthumously printed.</p><p>These copies and several single
plates have been newly collated for the present edition—with the result
that many of the deleted passages have been recovered, partly with the aid
of photographic enlargement. (A 6th copy, G, not located since 1921, has never
been described.  Copy B, of 25 colored plates, i.e. the first chapter only,
is apparently contemporaneous with A and C, the watermark date being 1818.
 Blake Trust color facsimile 1974.)</p><pb n="809"/><p>  The arrangement of
plates does not vary except in Chapter 2, where the present text follows that
of copies A, C, and F, the text familiar in the Rinder facsimile.  The alternative
pagination, of copies D and E, is given in square brackets; that arrangement
is familiar in the texts of Geoffrey Keynes.  After two copies in the same
order, Blake printed two in a variant order (Keynes's <quote>“standard”</quote>) and then returned to the first. Evidently he found both sequences
attractive but considered neither definitive. (See comment above on the variety
of arrangements of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Songs of Innocence and of
Experience.</hi></title>)</p><p><hi rend="i">Date:</hi> See textual note on <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton,</hi></title> above. <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Jerusalem</hi></title> was etched and in present form largely composed after <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton,</hi></title> though their <quote>“1804”</quote> title pages suggest some overlapping.  Some pages were written and
perhaps a few were etched, the Preface for instance, during the enthusiasm
of the post-Felpham years.  After his 1809 Exhibition, Blake may have turned
to his two epics simultaneously, but he first completed and etched <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton</hi></title> the final text of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title> can hardly have been completed before 1815.
Most of the etching was probably done in 1815-20, but the deletion-marked
pages such as the Preface may survive from an earlier etching.  Proof copies
of Plates 28, 40[45], and 56 were made on paper dated 1802.  The fact that <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title> shows much more variation from
plate to plate than <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton,</hi></title> however,
almost certainly signifies a much longer span of composition and production.
 True, it was Blake's conscious aim to achieve breadth and variety of graphic
and verbal effects befitting an epic, but time as well as stylistic choice
seems to have caused some of the differences among the plates.</p><p>

in five Complete and seven incomplete copies.</p><p>     These plates, in
line engraving rather than the relief etching of most of Blake's Illuminated
 Printing, were easily retouched from issue to issue, the later copies being
more and more highly finished.  The revision of text was fairly easy also,

 As late as <quote>“Novr 22nd 1806”</quote> when  <quote>“Henry
Fuseli”</quote> was inscribing a gift copy <quote>“To Harriet

copy (now lost) with the earliest version <title level="a">“For the

(with the later wording only in line 5 of the Prologue) is on 1818 paper;
the third state occurs on paper of 1825; a final state is darker.  It might
be unwise to date the earliest <title level="a">“Sexes”</title>
version as late as 1818, though it was certainly a good deal later than 1806.

may have corrected earlier proofs: there are relatively few printer's errors,

we find his use of commas to compel enjambement.  The colon after <quote>“hopes”</quote> in line 49 is probably the printer's misreading

133 pages of titles and text written on 70 large sheets (about 16 1/2 X 12
1/2 inches) plus some draft material on two small leaves and a fragment. 
Of the large sheets, 47 consist of engraved proofs of designs Blake had made
for Young's <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi></title> in 1795-96
and two were made by cutting in half a print of Blake's early engraving, <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Edward and Elenor.</hi></title> Blake wrote on both
sides of most leaves—including the engraved proofs, which had open spaces
where Young's text was to be printed.  Drawings intended as illumination were
made on 84 pages (including the backs of proofs), and the engraved designs
on the proofs seem to have been chosen as reminders of drawings he would include
in the perfected manuscript. (The draft material, pages 141-145, is dealt
with in the notes to pp 7, 105, and 106 and at the end of the notes to this
poem.)</p><p>     For a detailed if sometimes confusing account of the ms
with a reproduction of all the pages in half-tone plates, see <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Vala or the Four Zoas,</hi></title> edited by G. E. Bentley, Jr (Clarendon
Press 1963).  In 1981 a facsimile made from infra-red photographs is being
prepared, with commentary on the pictures by Cettina Magno and myself.</p><p>In pages 1, 3-18, 23-42, begun on clean sheets of paper, we can see that
Blake's initial aim was a manuscript in fine copperplate script.  Revisions
at first made neatly over erasures or in the wide paragraph breaks maintain
this objective with a modified yet still elegant engraver's hand.  Further
revisions and additions, however, squeezed between lines and spilling into
margins, are in Blake's usual plain hand, as is all the text inscribed on
the blank spaces of the proof pages.</p><p>     Possibly a complete <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Vala</hi></title> in copperplate hand was produced
but lay unsold and open to revision which gradually reduced it to a working
ms.  On the other hand, it may be that the aim to keep each page in copperplate
perfection was sustained through a decade or more of labor over the text and
drawings, a descent to ordinary hand on any given page occurring only when
that page<pb n="817"/>                                  became too cluttered
with revisions to be saved as perfect. (By this definition, pages 14-18, 26,
33, 40 are unspoiled, and pages 24, 29, 38, 41 have changes suggested in pencil
that could still be perfected by careful erasure and inking: contrariwise,
the minor but effacing revisions on pages 19, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39 may mean
that Blake was giving up.) (See note on p 40, below.)</p><p>After Blake's
death the ms was in loose sheets, but stitch- marks show he had once sewed
together into one group all the sheets with elegant script and into another
group those sheets containing pages 43-84 and 111-112, all in his usual hand.
Possibly he thought of one group as finished, the other as preliminary, and
any existing sheets not stitched as rejects (for example, Night VIIb, when
he thought of replacing it with VIIa).</p><p>At various stages of revision
Blake counted his lines in each Night, sometimes by 100s, sometimes by 50s
or 10s, and only pages 19-22, 87-90, and 111-116 lack numbering of any sort.
 But all Nights contain additions made after the latest counting.</p><p><hi rend="i">Date:</hi> ca 1796-18O7? The <quote>“1797”</quote>
in the title may mark the beginning of a first fair copy, while pages 141-142
represent a fragment of a preliminary draft.  The work is named <title level="a">
“the Book of Vala”</title> in an early, erased stratum of page
3; Bentley (p 177) suggests that it may have been <quote>“originally
organized in `Books' as a continuation of”</quote><title level="m"><hi rend="i">The First Book of Urizen,</hi></title> noting that borrowings from <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Urizen</hi></title> occur in Nights IV and V and that
these Nights are called <quote>“the Fourth Book”</quote> and <quote>“Book the Fifth”</quote> on pp 56 and 57.  Also to be noted is
the use of <quote>“Book”</quote> for <quote>“Night”</quote> in VIIb, p 95.  (But Margoliouth, p 121, argues that the use of <quote>“Book”</quote> is a sign of <quote>“very late”</quote>
indifference—or <quote>“a deliberate, but abandoned, idea of giving
up the `Nights'”</quote>.)</p><p>     It has been tempting to suppose
that successive layers of copperplate, modified copperplate, and usual hand
represent successive and datable stages in the growth of the ms.  On this
supposition all the pages in usual hand should be later than those in copperplate—and
all the latter should have fairly finished drawings.  But the drawings vary
in finish throughout. And on certain copperplate pages a distinctly late style
appears in the script, marked by the g which Blake adopted after Nov. 1802.
 On pages 8 and 10 this style appears in modified copperplate hand in revisions
made before clutter had set in; on page 12 the basic layer of text itself
is in fine copperplate hand of this late character—and so is the chapter
heading of <quote>“Night the Sixth”</quote> on page 67. (It should
be added that I have found no distinguishing marks of a pre-1803 script in
any part of the ms, all the other g's being of the dateless, sans-serif variety:
The rule of <hi rend="i">g</hi> may of course be less invariable than I have
supposed.  At any rate it is safer to conclude that the copperplate pages
range in inception from 1797 to 18O3 than to put them all in the later period.)
</p><p>     Bentley has found that the sheet on which pages 48-49 were written
(at the beginning of Night IV) bears evidence of prior use as a backing-sheet
when Blake printed Hayley's first Ballad in May 18O2, but his argument (p
195) that sheets marred or defective in some such way as this were the last
ones Blake would use should upset his assumption that none of the pages following
49 were inscribed before that date.  As for the date of stitching of either
of the groups described above, the second group includes the sheet with the
May 1802 impressions and so cannot have been stitched earlier than that; that
neither group can have been stitched earlier than 1803 should be the deduction
from the graphic evidence of late <hi rend="i">g</hi>'s in the first strata
of pages in both groups (12 and 67).  To suppose the other, unpierced pages
not to have been <hi rend="i">written</hi> before 18O3 would shake all present
assumptions.</p><p>    Even if an 18O3 date for the copying out of <quote>“Night the Sixth”</quote> is accepted, its composition may have
been much earlier. On the other hand the date of 1804 or later which has been
accepted for Night VIII on the basis of allusions to the renewal of war and
of strikingly different symbolism or idiom from the main body of the poem
(see Margoliouth, p 174) may need correction to <quote>“much later”</quote>.  The writing of VIII, at least, and the very late change of the
poem's title to <title level="a">“The Four Zoas”</title> (a pencil
revision on the main title page not extended to the chapter headings) as well
as a good deal of mending and revising, especially in Night I, must have occurred
after Blake had begun if not completed <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Milton
</hi></title> and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem.</hi></title> Bentley's
contention (p 165) that several passages were borrowed from <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem,</hi></title> rather than the other way round, is not convincing
in respect to passages in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title>
22 and 67-68, but the connections of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Vala,</hi></title>
1, 21, 99 and <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem</hi></title> 34[38]
may go in both directions.</p><p>     It should be recognized, however, that
many apparently late additions to <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Vala</hi></title>
turn out to have been salvaged from the erasure of early layers on the same
or other pages.  Since few of these erased early strata have been deciphered,
we cannot be certain how much of the late material is actually new. (See the
textual notes on pages 4, 6, 7, 72, 99.)</p><pb n="818"/><p>     Readers should
be cautioned against failing back on the all too hypothetical chronological
groupings of Nights and parts of Nights presented in Erdman, 1st edition pp
270-271 (on the basis of secondhand evidence and an ignorance of the complexities
of the ms).  Nevertheless certain salient historical allusions or sources
remain, despite uncertainty as to how long after the event Blake wrote: negotiations
conducted between Britain and France, in 1796 and 1797 (but again in 1800
and 1801); the Netherlands expedition of 1799; Napoleon's coup d'état
a few weeks later; the Peace of Amiens; its rupture.  Readers should also
be cautioned against inaccuracies and special pleading in Bentley's criticism
of these groupings (pp 168-170)—and of course also against exaggerations
in my subsequent critique of the Bentley volume (in an article in <title level="s"><hi rend="i">The Library</hi></title> for 1964).</p><p>Bentley's warning
that a second or third addition on one page may have no chronological relation
with a second or third addition on another is well taken—but frequently
ignored by all of us.  His assumption that the original copperplate writing
on all pages represents a single draft may or may not prove to be sound; yet
his transcript obscures the evidence by treating the erased copperplate layer
as nonexistent (when he cannot read it) and the first added layer as original.</p><p>     Margoliouth's attempt to isolate a <title level="a">“Vala”
</title> text by selecting Blake's <quote>“fair copy of each Night before
erasures, deletions, additions, and changes of order”</quote> depends
heavily on the assumption that all these deduced fair copies (excluding VIII
and the first part of IX) somehow constitute a homogeneous text.  He is able
to sort out pretty successfully those lines which were in the ms when Blake
counted and numbered his lines by fifties, but not to convince us that all
the counting took place at one time. The result is useful, however, and only
misleading if taken as a really early state of the text or as constituting
a uniform layer, so to speak.</p><p>The complexities of the ms, in short,
continue to defy analysis and all assertions about meaningful physical groupings
or chronologically definable layers of composition or inscription must be
understood to rest on partial and ambiguous evidence.</p><p>     The text
given here is simply that of the latest readings, with deletions occasionally
retained (in italics within square brackets) when their omission would leave
gaps; when Blake replaced a deleted reading and then deleted the replacement,
the earlier reading has been restored.  The textual notes contain all the
erased or deleted readings thus far deciphered (sometimes differing from or
going beyond the Bentley transcript thanks largely to the use of infrared
photography and strong magnification).  Nights editorially designated VII
and VIIb (or VIIa and VIIb) and treated as separate entities in previous editions
are here conflated into a single <quote>“Night the Seventh”</quote>.
But the distinction between VII and VIIb is indicated in the bracketed note
at the head of each page.</p><p>     Line numbers are given page for page,
but to facilitate use of the Blake <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Concordance
</hi></title> of 1968, which gives line numbers Night for Night as in the
Keynes editions, the Keynes numbers are supplied in each page heading, thus
bracked: { }.</p><p>     A new facsimile edition of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
The Four Zoas,</hi></title> using improved photography and attempting a plate-by-plate
commentary on the illuminations in the manuscript, is being prepared by Professor
Cettina Magno of Messina, and myself, with the plates arranged in an order
closer to Blake's than that given the loose ms leaves by the twentieth-century
binder.  The rearrangement involves twelve leaves (twenty-four pages) to produce
the following sequence, giving the traditional arrangement in parentheses:
</p><p><table><row><cell>19(21)</cell><cell>87(95)</cell><cell>95(87)</cell><cell>105(113)</cell><cell>109(105)</cell><cell>113(109)</cell></row><row><cell>20(22)</cell><cell>88(96)</cell><cell>96(88)</cell><cell>106(114)</cell><cell>110(1O6)</cell><cell>114(110)</cell></row><row><cell>21(19)</cell><cell>89(97)</cell><cell>97(89)</cell><cell>107(115)</cell><cell>111(1O7)</cell><cell>115(111)</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>22(20)</cell><cell>90(98)</cell><cell>98(90)</cell><cell>108(116)</cell><cell>112(108)</cell><cell>116(112)</cell></row></table></p><p>This arrangement will put the pictures in a more meaningful
sequence, but to adopt it in the present text would be confusing, since Blake's
poem moves about (because of his own revisions) in a sequence that does not
correspond exactly to any sequence of the manuscript leaves.</p><p>     1: <hi rend="i">title</hi>] VALA / OR / The Death and Judgement of the <del>[<hi rend="i">Eternal</hi>]</del><add>&lt;Ancient&gt;</add> Man / a DREAM / of Nine

additional lines.  The top block of 9 added lines has been deleted, then restored
by an ink circle, then heavily revised; the last of these (line 7 in the present
text) is so crossed out and mended that to restore it Blake has written <quote>“This line to come in”</quote> alongside.  The lower half of the
page consists of original copperplate writing, with some mending and some
deletion of lines.  The undeleted original lines appear also on p 143 (a smaller
leaf but neatly written as if begun as fair copy, perhaps of a draft preceding
the large copperplate pages) and are there revised.  Until recently it has
been assumed that the revisions of p 143 were later than the final text of
p 7, but Andrew Lincoln argues convincingly that the final revisions on p
7 are later than those on p 143.  In line 10, for instance, the <quote>“Half
Woman &amp; half Spectre”</quote> was first half <quote>“Serpent”</quote> on p 7; On p 143 <quote>“Serpent”</quote> was first written
and then replaced by <quote>“beast”</quote> but not by <quote>“Spectre”</quote> (which in the whole context must be the final
term); thus the final p 7 reading, <quote>“Spectre”</quote>, is
later than the p 143 revision.  In the evolution of serpent to beast to spectre,
the p 143 revisions constitute a middle or <quote>“beast”</quote>
stage.  The changes from <quote>“scaly armour”</quote> to <quote>“rocky features”</quote>, from <quote>“lovely changing colours”</quote> to <quote>“darkly waving colours”</quote>, and from <quote>“monster”</quote> to <quote>“wonder”</quote> were
thus temporary; in p 7 the Spectre reassumes the bright, scaly, monstrous
quality of the Serpent. (In the first edition of this book the revisions of
p 143 were taken as final text, a mistake now corrected.) (The text of p 143
is given at the end of these textual notes on <title level="m"><hi rend="i">

lines in copperplate hand (under lines 7-18 in Bentley's numbering).  All
six were apparently moved to p 5 for the modified copperplate addition there
of lines 9-14. and 25.  At least the 4th line is identical to 5:12 except
for punctuation:</p><lg><l>And said Return O Wanderer when the day of clouds is o'er;</l></lg><p>and the 5th is a variant of 5:13-14:</p><lg><l>So saying he . . . ?fell . . . into the restless  sea</l></lg><p>and the 3rd is like 5:11 in beginning with a <hi rend="i">T,</hi>

be <quote>“head”</quote>, that of 5:9; the 2nd is illegible but
its configuration does not jar with that of 5:10. The 6th erased line is identical

them are two versions of a passage to be adapted from the  deleted text of
p 8 and to lead into line 143:11-13 (<quote>“And thus   her voice”</quote> et cetera).  In the deletions of p 8 (lines 5-13     following 8:7)
Enion broods, after bearing two infants, and     vegetation grows up from
the rough rocks to shelter them. The    revision seems intended to have the
vegetation grow up to     shelter Enion before she gives birth to the children.
</p><p>     The version at the bottom of p 143 (possibly written     first)
is crowded in like prose, but it may be lined out with    the help of Blake's
slashes and capitals.  The initial half     line may have been meant to replace
the preceding terminal half line, <quote>“a Self enjoying wonder”</quote> (143:9).  Here is the     version, with instructions to copy everything
from <quote>“The b . .  .”</quote>  to <quote>“Infolding
. . .”</quote>:</p><lg><l>Shining across the ocean /</l><l>Enion brooded groaning the golden rocks vegetate</l><l>  The b . . . <supplied>[paper torn away]</supplied></l><l>to</l><l>Infolding the bright woman from the desolating winds/</l><l>  &amp; thus her voice &amp;<supplied>[c]</supplied><supplied>[paper torn

</p><lg><l>The barked Oak, the long limbd Beech; the Ches'nut                tree;
the Pine.</l></lg><p>and to copy the next five lines, filled with vegetation and animation,
concluding with:</p><lg><l>Infolding the bright Infants from the desolating winds</l></lg><p>—but with <quote>“the bright woman”</quote> replacing
the Infants.  Blake subsequently deleted all this version except for the phrase <quote>“Infolding the bright woman”</quote>.</p><p>    The alternative
version, not deleted, consists of a double line crowded into the stanza break
between <quote>“a Self enjoying wonder”</quote> and <quote>“And
thus her voice”</quote>. Here the vegetating is more complex, involving
seas, rocks, and vortex:</p><lg><l>For Enion brooded groaning loud the rough seas                vegetate.</l><l>  Golden rocks rise from the <del>[<hi rend="i">vorte . .</hi>]</del><add>&lt;vast&gt;</add></l><l><supplied>[paper torn; <quote>“vast”</quote> written on top

to <quote>“Infolding the bright woman”</quote> (undeleted portion
of the first version): it would make up a full line; and perhaps to conclude

faint impression of mirror-printing: `Ballad the First', &amp;c.”</quote>
from p 9 of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Ballads Relating to Animals</hi></title>
by William Hayley, for which Blake made engravings dated 1 June 1802.  Bentley
(p 162) deduces that the sheet was used as backing when Blake printed the
Ballad and only later used as ms paper.  His further deduction or assertion
that <quote>“There is no evidence to suggest that any of the succeeding
pages [of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas</hi></title>] were transcribed <hi rend="i">before</hi> page 48”</quote> is contradicted by his own argument
(on pp 194-195 on <quote>“Anomalous pages <supplied>[i.e.  leaves]</supplied>”
</quote>) to the effect that such imperfect leaves as this would have been
avoided by Blake until he reached the end of his supply of perfect leaves.
The discovery, in short, helps date pages 47-48, but it also seems to mark
them as a late insertion. (Bentley does not count 47-48 among the anomalies.
His categories consist of odd-sized leaves; <quote>“make-shift”</quote> leaves made of two overlapping pieces of paper but otherwise of good
size and good enough to have been used for <title level="m"><hi rend="i">
Night Thoughts</hi></title> proofs—for all the leaves under discussion
are proofs made in 1796, with one possible exception, and available for ms
use any time thereafter; three sheets that were once folded together horizontally;
one with a small patch in the inner margin.  In another group Bentley counts
as <quote>“very late”</quote> a sheet cut into two leaves bearing
Blake's 1793 engraving of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Edward &amp; Elenor
</hi></title> on one side.  Yet leaf 47-48 is described (p 4-8 n) as having
vertical <quote>“creases . . . as if [from] a great weight”</quote><quote>
“made after the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Night Thoughts</hi></title>
engraving was printed, but after <supplied>[sc. before?]</supplied> the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Vala</hi></title> writing . . .”</quote>. Presumably
the creases were made by the weight of the press and before ms use, or the
whole argument collapses; elsewhere Bentley is fairly confident that the writing <quote>
“appears to be <hi rend="i">on top of</hi> the printing”</quote>
(p 162 n 1); he apparently also means us to connect the <quote>“creases”</quote> with the process which made <quote>“a regular indentation .
. . where Blake's copperplate repeatedly pressed the paper”</quote>.
 These creases and indentation surely qualify the leaf for inclusion among
such <quote>“anomalous”</quote> leaves as the three once folded;
the transferred printing would seem to put it rather further along the scale
toward the very imperfect end.</p><p>     Another kind of evidence that a
succeeding page was transcribed <hi rend="i">before</hi> pages 47-48 is the
striking fact that p 57, the title of Night The Fifth, is so early it first
read <quote>“Book”</quote> (<hi rend="i">erased</hi> and written <quote>“Night”</quote>), while no such early wording occurs on the title

identified as VIIa (pp 77-90) and VIIb (91-98).  The text of VIIa, when first
inscribed as fair copy from drafts not extant, ended at 85:22, fitting fairly
well the fair-copy opening of VIIb (91:1) but not smoothly.  From the nature
of the fit it is reasonable to conjecture that 91-98 (VIIb) already existed.
These pages remain fair copy with minor revisions, but Blake achieved one
drastic revision by writing instructions to himself on pages 91, 95, and 98
to begin <quote>“the Seventh Night”</quote> with 95:15 and move
the preceding passages (91:1 to 95:14) around to follow the end of 98—a
change which improved the fitting of VIIa to VIIb. (In either sequence VIIb
could bring the Night to a cadence, ready for Night VIII.) But later Blake
erased the finish line after 85:22 and extended VIIa, first for a few lines,
with a new finis line, then, erasing that, to the bottom of the page and on
into the margins of picture page 86, originally a tailpiece for the Night;
then on through pages 87 and 90 (there being no room for text on pages 88-89).
 This new termination of the Night fitted VIIa very nicely to the beginning
of Night VIII, but it left VIIb dangling. Blake might have thought to discard
VIIb, but he did not do so; it contains passages needed in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Four Zoas,</hi></title> somewhere. But their disposition remains
an editorial problem, with no instructions from the author.</p><p>     Recently
three scholars, working independently, have come up with three proposed reading
sequences, each more elegant than simply taking VIIa and VIIb consecutively.
 Andrew Lincoln, arguing from an impressive hypothetical reconstruction of
the evolution of the ms, would insert VIIa between the two portions of VIIb
(as Blake rearranged them).  Mark Lefebvre and John Kilgore, arguing mainly
from fit, propose inserting all of VIIb between the two portions of VIIa (taking
the first portion of VIIa as concluding with 85:22, originally followed by <quote>“End of the Seventh Night”</quote>).  Kilgore would return the
transposed parts of VIIb to their original order; Lefebvre would keep them
in the order of Blake's transposing.  In the present edition I have decided
to follow the latter course. (All these proposals are discussed in detail
in the Summer 1978 issue of <title level="s"><hi rend="i">Blake: An Illustrated

of all but the first and last two lines of p 90 would work quite well at this
point; one would need merely to change the phrase <quote>“Into his hands”</quote> that begins 100:2 into <quote>“In his hands”</quote>

with marginal additions, seems all an amplification backward from the <quote>“Looms in Lubans Gate”</quote> in 100:2.</p><p>     In short,
Blake wrote the two pages 87 and 90 as a sequence, considered using the second
page as a second page for Night VIII (i.e. inserting it on p 100), but then
chose to tighten the sequence (with additions at bottom of 87 and top of 90)
and insert it (unquestionably a late addition) at the end of VII. This bit
of masonry (the fitting Of 87 to 90 and to 86) which cements VII(a) closely
to VIII seems to indicate a time when Blake considered VIIb as abandoned (or
moved).  It should be noted that 90:1 is probably an addition, the text originally
starting within the platemark, and that 99:26-27 are an addition, which must
be treated parenthetically, made to round out the tale when the idea of bringing
in the <quote>“Los stood . . . in the Gate of Luban”</quote> passage
had been abandoned; hence too the deletion of <quote>“at the Gate”</quote> in 99:25.</p><pb n="841"/><p>     1 recieving them] Los receiving <quote>“the dead”</quote> of 99:19</p></note><note id="tn372.8"><p>11-13 Astonishd . . .  saw] Astonishd Comforted delighted

of the irregularities and defects to be found in almost every page, his friends

1800 to 1808.  For other Notebook poems, see <title level="a">“Satiric

were made in pale ink, the later in dark ink.  The title change was made in
pale ink and indicates the striking change of emphasis in the revisions of
18-20.  In the first draft the tenor is that the fairy's belief in the power
of the ring is shown by my act of catching him: the fact that he's my fly
proves the ring foolish. The second reading is ambiguous, with emphasis swinging
toward the speaker: I have pulled out the sting of the superstition and rendered
the ring powerless.  In the final version (given in the text, above) the change
from <quote>“&amp;”</quote> to <quote>“For”</quote>
renders the act undated, or predated: <hi rend="i">Because</hi> I have (already)

the following four, the first two of which are numbered 1 and 2 as if to begin
a new poem.  I have treated them as such here (i.e. as a Postscript); yet
it is possible that Blake meant 1 and 2 (dropping the third and fourth, which
he left unnumbered) to replace the first two stanzas of the Spectre poem.
 Such a final draft can be made to work perfectly <hi rend="i">if</hi> the
third stanza is skipped (i.e. if Postscript stanzas 1 and 2 are followed by
line 13).  The resulting poem of 13 stanzas (quite possibly intended by Blake)
would be a direct dialogue of a male and female without reference to Spectre
or Emanation and without differentiation (not sustained anyway) between the <quote>“I”</quote> speaking and <quote>“My Spectre”</quote>.

Fayette stanzas that were added below.</p></note></div3><div3 page="861" id="z1.11.4"><pb n="862"/><head rend="center"><quote>“Who will exchange his own fire side”</quote><hi rend="i">N</hi> 99-98 rev</head><note id="tn500.4"><p>Below the last stanza of the preceding poem, and perhaps
originally as a continuation of it although now separated by a horizontal
line, Blake wrote and then deleted the following:</p><lg><l>Fayette Fayette thourt bought &amp; sold</l><l>For well I see thy tears</l><l>Of Pity are exchangd for those</l><l>Of selfish slavish fears</l></lg><p>Perhaps before deleting this stanza (just possibly before writing
it) he wrote three stanzas in the adjacent column, guided by a line to precede
it—or replace it:</p><lg><l>Fayette beside King Lewis stood</l><l>He saw him sign his hand</l><l>And soon he saw the famine rage</l><l>About the fruitful land</l></lg><lg><l>Fayette beheld the Queen to smile</l><l>And wink her lovely eye</l><l>And soon he saw the pestilence</l><l>From street to street to fly</l></lg><lg><l>[1]  Fayette beheld the King &amp; Queen</l><l>In tears &amp; iron bound</l><l>But mute Fayette wept tear for tear</l><l>And guarded them around</l></lg><p>At some point the first two of these stanzas were firmly crossed out
and the third numbered <quote>“1”</quote>; later that number was
lined through, perhaps when the stanza was recopied on p 98:</p><p>At
the top of p 98 Blake began afresh, abandoning everything on p 99 that he
did not repeat here:</p><lg><l><del>[<hi rend="i">Fayette beside his banner stood</hi>]</del></l><l><del>[<hi rend="i">His captains false around</hi>]</del></l><l><del>[<hi rend="i">Thourt bought &amp; sold</hi>]</del></l></lg><lg><l>[3]  Who will exchange his own fire side</l><l>For the steps of anothers door</l><l>Who will exchange his wheaten loaf</l><l>For the links of a dungeon floor</l></lg><p>Though only the numeral <quote>“3”</quote> of this stanza
is deleted, the whole stanza is rewritten farther down the page.</p><p>  
  But first Blake tried two lines of a variant, immediately canceled, and
then four lines, later numbered <quote>“2”</quote> and later still
crossed out:</p><lg><l><del>[<hi rend="i">Who will exchange his own hearts blood</hi>]</del></l><l><del> [<hi rend="i">For the drops of a harlots eye</hi>]</del></l></lg><lg><l>[2]  Will the mother exchange her new born babe</l><l>For the dog at the wintry door</l><l>Yet thou dost exchange thy pitying tears</l><l>For the links of a dungeon floor</l></lg><p>Before this stanza was deleted and before deletion of the numbers <quote>“1”</quote> and <quote>“3”</quote> alongside earlier
stanzas, Blake had his first version of a three-stanza poem of Fayette and
King and Queen. But he went on to write a new first stanza:</p><lg><l>1</l><l>Fayette Fayette thourt bought &amp; sold</l><l>And sold is thy happy morrow</l><pb n="863"/><l>Thou gavest the tears of Pity away</l><l>In exchange for the tears of sorrow</l></lg><p>     Before crossing this out Blake wrote <quote>“2”</quote>
beside the first line, then <quote>“1”</quote> on top of that.
 But then leaving a 3/4 inch space he began afresh, inscribing the three stanzas
printed in our text—first the Fayette stanza, then the <quote>“fire
side”</quote> stanza, then the <quote>“wintry seas”</quote>
stanza.  He then renumbered them <quote>“2”</quote>, <quote>“3”</quote>, <quote>“1”</quote>; then changed the <quote>“3”</quote> to <quote>“1”</quote> and vice versa, producing the sequence
we have used.</p><p>     While superficially the ms gives the appearance of
a great many stanzas, sufficient to compose another Chattertonian ballad like <title level="a"><quote>“Gwin, King of Norway”</quote></title>, it can
be seen that with the Fayette stanzas Blake almost at once was aiming at a
three-stanza triptych, a tableau poem of three mute figures like the three
in the frontispiece of<title level="m"><hi rend="i">Visions of the Daughters
of Albion</hi></title>— or the three <hi rend="i">Accusers</hi> (see
Inscriptions).  Most of his energy on these two manuscript pages, once the
Fayette-King-Queen idea has grown out of the <quote>“Brothels”</quote> poem, is expended on arranging and rearranging a few simple rhetorical
questions around the central frozen image of a moment of betrayal located
at the storm center of the French Revolution.</p></note><note id="tn500.5"><p>2 stone] steps 1<hi rend="i">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id="tn500.6"><p>6 curses] tears 1<hi rend="i">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id="tn500.7"><p>10 &amp; Pity] Or Pity 1<hi rend="i">st rdg</hi></p></note></div3><div3 page="863" id="z1.11.5"><head rend="center"><quote>“When Klopstock England defied”</quote><hi rend="i">N</hi> 1 (pencil)</head><note id="tn500.8"><p><hi rend="i">Date:</hi> ca 1797-99, for Blake would

the British Library) and three sections in a separate scrap of paper (in the
Rosenbach Foundation library) have long been recognized as parts of a single
but unfinished (or perhaps only unedited) poem.  In previous editions of this
text (and in my essay <quote>“Uprose Terrible Blake”</quote>,
in <title level="m"><hi rend="i">From Sensibility to Romanticism</hi></title>,
Oxford, 1965, and in the Erdman and Moore facsimile of the <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Notebook</hi></title>, 1973, 1977) Keynes's lettering of these 12
sections, from <hi rend="i">a</hi> to <hi rend="i">l</hi>, has been followed
for convenience though it represents neither the order nor the probable sequence
intended by Blake, who made no known fair copy. In the following table these
sections are given a new letter sequence representing the probable order of
composition established in the essay just cited and accepted in the 1978 Bentley
text.</p><p>     Two other small sections, not hitherto recognized as such,
form a sort of Preface and are included now (1981) as <hi rend="i">m</hi>
and <hi rend="i">n</hi>. Their identification was prompted by John Grant's
current study of the presence of Joseph of Arimathea in Blake.</p><p>

(as lines 3-4 are), and has been printed as lines 21-24 of <hi rend="i">k
</hi> despite some obvious incongruity; section <hi rend="i">n</hi> has been
printed as a separate and unrelated poem.  I can now see (and Grant agrees)
that just as Blake supplied a preface to <hi rend="i">Europe a Prophecy</hi>
telling of a laughing tipsie Fairy who sings wisdom and who has <quote>“dictated
EUROPE”</quote>, so, when he gave <quote>“The Everlasting Gospel”</quote> its title, he made a preface for it out of his Fairy's report of
the words of Joseph of Arimathea, the man who <quote>“was standing by
when Jesus died”</quote> and whose scorn of <quote>“such desperate
Fools”</quote> as Pliny and Trajan (who corresponded within the century
of Christ's death about how to punish the impudent sect of Christians since
slaying them only multiplied them) is expressed in <hi rend="i">n</hi>.</p><p>     In the opening of the poem proper (<hi rend="i">k</hi>) the weighting
of Pride and Humility is reversed: Pliny (for example) called proud (obdurate,
perverse) those Christians who accepted punishment and death without recanting.
 The speaker in <hi rend="i">k</hi> (still Joseph perhaps— perhaps the
poet's debating voice) stresses the aggressive, <quote>“triumphant Pride”</quote> of a Christ who curses the rulers. (For further pronominal reference
perhaps to Joseph, see <hi rend="i">b</hi>:17, 21-22 and note.)</p><p>     Blake's final intentions are not certain, but his revisions seem to
have aimed at reducing the poem to the sequence<hi rend="i">kfi</hi> with <hi rend="i">mn</hi> as Preface and <hi rend="i">e</hi> as a personal Epilogue.
 The other sections are given in full in the following notes, which attempt
to reconstruct the sequence of composition.</p><p>I take it that Blake began with the following prose paragraph in the

drama remains the static threefold scene: Christ and Lucifer arguing their
opposite views before <quote>“Me”</quote> (Every man, or Joseph
of Arimathea, or Blake).  In a quickly deleted passage (the last line, p 2)
Jesus was going to speak <quote>“to me”</quote> about Jerusalem,

quote Caiaphas on Jesus—but the informing voice is soon the Devil of
Blake's <title level="a">“Memorable Fancy”</title> of  <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</hi></title>.  There
is more Blake than Caiaphas in the inserted lines on the <quote>“Bloody
Shrine Of War”</quote>; he is still feeling for the right form and tone.
</p><p>     Next, or concomitantly, he wrote another scrap, alluded to in <hi rend="i">g</hi> but now lost. </p><p>     Then, past the preliminaries, he turned to his main Notebook, by 1818
crammed with the drawings and essays and epigrams and songs of 30 years. 
Leafing forward from the front, Blake was not skipping any blanks of great
size when he inscribed section e on page 33, though there were slightly larger
spaces on 27, 28, and 30.  Perhaps his first intention was a six-line stanza;
the next eight lines are amplification, somewhat crowded in.  After p 33 he
might have used 44-45, but the next opening was ampler, with two open pages
(48-49) and large blanks on 50-51 and smaller on 52-54. (As the poem took
shape, Blake clustered his sections close together; if one argues for a late
date for <hi rend="i">a b c</hi>, as truly <quote>“supplementary”</quote>, one must account for heir being written outside the Notebook when
there was ample rom for them on pp 44-45 and elsewhere.  The same point applies
to <hi rend="i">d</hi>, unless one argues improbably that the leaf was sewed
into the Notebook before d was written on it.)</p><p>     On 48-52 he wrote section <hi rend="i">f</hi>, rapidly, having found
the poem's Socratic rhetorical pattern.  The section concluded at first with
lines 93-94, on p 52, and Blake counted up and inscribed his total as <quote>“94 lines”</quote>, later adding 95-96 in an adjacent column.
 Immediately below this total he wrote 2 1/2 lines, with an etcetera, meaning
to bring in a passage from somewhere else (something written before the Notebook
entries):</p></div3><div3 page="878" id="z1.12.11"><head rend="center">     [g]</head><milestone rend="left" n="54" unit="page"/><lg><l>Seeing this False Christ In fury &amp; Passion</l><l>I made my Voice heard all over the Nation</l><l>What are those &amp;c</l></lg><p>We cannot reconstruct the <quote>“&amp;c”</quote> (though it

we be quite sure whether Blake next wrote <hi rend="i">h, j,</hi> or <hi rend="i">
i</hi>, each working out the successful formula of <hi rend="i">f</hi> in
application to another Moral Virtue: Humility (<hi rend="i">j</hi>), Gentility
(<hi rend="i">i</hi>), and the philosophical <quote>“doubt”</quote>
of Voltaire and company who <quote>“are constantly talking of the Virtues
of the Human Heart”</quote> (<title level="m"><hi rend="i">Jerusalem

Voltaire Bacon &amp;”</quote>—the etcetera again signifying a
lost passage to be brought in, or perhaps referring—as <hi rend="i">
et al</hi>—to Newton and Locke.</p><p>     There is some evidence that Blake wrote the Gentility section (<hi rend="i">i</hi>, on pages 100-101, the first large open space after <hi rend="i">
f</hi>) before the Humility (<hi rend="i">j</hi>, in a narrow column on p
98).  The spacing of the ms lines of <hi rend="i">e, f, i</hi> (and also <hi rend="i">d</hi>) is about 4 to 4 1/2 to an inch, regardless of crowding, while <hi rend="i">c</hi> and its revision <hi rend="i">k</hi> are spaced about 5 1/2
to 6 lines an inch.</p><p>     As the handwriting shrinks, the mending, revision, and rearrangement
of lines increase.  The revised Humility section, <hi rend="i">k</hi>, amplified
from 51 lines to <quote>“78 lines”</quote>—as Blake counted,
going on with marginal insertions to make it 106—was fitted into the
relatively narrow space on pp 52—54 following <hi rend="i">f</hi>. But
then he decided to put <hi rend="i">f</hi> (Chastity) after <hi rend="i">
k</hi> (Humility), cuing at the end of the latter section: <quote>“Was
Jesus Chaste or did he &amp;c”</quote>, and writing a title for the
poem in at the head of <hi rend="i">k</hi>: <title level="a">“The Everlasting
Gospel”</title>.</p><p>Then he squeezed in the prefatory merriment of <hi rend="i">m</hi> and <hi rend="i">n</hi>, probably in that order.  At about this point (in the book
if not in time) he also wrote a wry comment (<hi rend="i">l</hi>) on this
poem of true Christ which the spirit of Joseph of Arimathea, via Blake's devilish
or Spectre voice, was uttering.</p><p>     And then he stopped.  He did not mark the <quote>“Gentility”</quote> passage to come in, nor did he count its lines.  He did not assemble
or mark the preface to come in.  It remains for editorial judgment to consider
whether <title level="a">“The Everlasting Gospel”</title> should
consist of the Humility and Chastity sections alone, or whether to bring in
the Gentility, perhaps anti-climactically and the prefatory <hi rend="i">
m n</hi>, and the summary <hi rend="i">e</hi> (at the end if anywhere): <hi rend="i">m n, k f i, e</hi>.  It does seem plain that the early sections must
be thought of as abandoned rather than <quote>“additional”</quote>
or <quote>“supplementary”</quote>.  The tangential sections, however,
as comments on the poem provoked from Blake's spiritual friend Joseph, and
from his doughty Spectre turning upon Voltaire, Bacon, and perhaps Rousseau
if not Newton and Locke, seem to merit being attached to the poem as glosses;
as such I have treated <hi rend="i">l</hi> and h, unable to recover enough
of <hi rend="i">g</hi>.</p><p>The variant readings of the included sections follow:</p></div3><div3 page="879" id="z1.12.13"><head rend="center">     [m]</head><note id="tn518.2"><p>2 very] <hi rend="i">inserted above the line</hi></p></note></div3><div3 page="879" id="z1.12.14"><head rend="center">     [n]</head><note id="tn518.3"><p>These four lines, the words of Joseph announced in <hi rend="i">m</hi>, have previously been considered to be lines 20-24 of section <hi rend="i">k</hi>, through what I now think to have been an editorial mistake.

Notebook.  The inclusion of <quote>“Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims”</quote> as a second title rests on the conjecture that <quote>“it may
well belong to this essay, of which the engraving of <title level="m"><hi rend="i">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi></title> is the ostensible subject”
</quote>, as Keynes observes.  <quote>“It seems probable . . . that
Blake was anticipating an announcement of the publication which he intended
to work up from the raw materials”</quote> of these Notebook paragraphs.
 In the second paragraph Blake conceives of the work as an address <quote>“to The Chalcographic Society”</quote>.  Chalcographers (engravers
on copper) had formed such a Society in 1802.  Blake's old partner James Parker
was a leading officer in 1803; articles in the <title level="s"><hi rend="i">
Examiner</hi></title> indicate its existence in 1810; Blake may have intended
to address the group in 1810 on the plight of <title level="a">“Engraving
as an Art”</title>.  See Dennis Read, <title level="a">“The Context
of Blake's <title level="m"><hi rend="i">Public Address</hi></title>: Cromek

Address was begun in the Notebook before <quote>“A Vision of the Last
Judgment”</quote> (see above) but continued after it.  Keynes has made
the first satisfactory attempt to weld these fragments into a unity, and his
arrangement is followed with a few minor exceptions.  For a complete transcript
and tabulation see the Erdman and Moore facsimile edition of the Notebook.

to be finished; some of the notes may have been written in 1809.  The second

which it skirts: <quote>“23 May 1810 found the Word Golden”</quote>.

date of 1789 given in John Knowles's Life of Fuseli.)</p><p>     Blake obtained
his copy unbound and made his notes so rapidly that the ink was blotted off
on adjacent leaves, heaped out of proper order.  A few afterthoughts were
written in pencil: those on Nos. 287 and 384 probably by Blake; an <quote>“Admirable!”</quote> on No. 20 and <quote>“No fumbler Kisses”</quote> on No. 503 by two different writers, probably friends to whom Blake
showed his marked copy as instructed in No.  643.</p><p>     Someone, probably
Blake himself, made the six substantive corrections called for by the page
of Errata—correcting <quote>“command”</quote> to <quote>“commands”</quote>, <quote>“whom”</quote> to <quote>“who”</quote>, <quote>“subtleness”</quote> to <quote>“sullenness”</quote>, <quote>“wise”</quote> to <quote>“rife”</quote> (not noticing that the listed word is another mistake
for <quote>“ripe”</quote>, the word called for by the sense),
and inserting an article—but ignored the eight corrections of punctuation
and spelling indicated.</p><p>     On the title page Blake wrote and underlined
his signature, <quote>“<hi rend="i">Willm Blake</hi>”</quote>,

of Reynolds' fifteen Discourses.  The Discourses were not unknown to Blake,
but this may have been his first opportunity to read them all.  The first
had been delivered at the opening of the Royal Academy, January 2, 1769, the
others at the nearly annual distribution of prizes to students, from 1769
to 1790.  In 1779, the year Blake entered the Academy schools, there was no
discourse, but he may possibly have heard one or both of the Ninth and Tenth
Discourses given in 1780.  Each Discourse was currently printed for limited
circulation; a collection of the first seven was published in 1778, but the
next (and complete) English edition was Malone's first, in 1797.</p><pb n="886"/><p>Blake's notes were written first in pencil and later, with erasures and

only, but unerased, are not distinguished from notes which are identical in
pencil and ink; notes in ink only are treated as additions.  Words partly
trimmed away in binding but still legible are treated as complete. (The unerased
pencil entries are those on pp ix, xxxiv, lx, xcvi, civ, cxx, 3, 5, 13, 48,

assumption that these marginalia are all of one kind written all at one tine
has resulted in the usual dating of them circa 1808, from the close relation
of some of them to satires in Blake's Notebook made before and perhaps while
he was writing his <title level="a">“Public Address”</title> of
1809.  But as early as November 22, 1802, he invoked the authority of <quote>“All Sir J Reynoldss discourses”</quote> in a letter to Thomas
Butts, emphasizing particularly Reynolds' admission of incompatibility between <quote>“Venetian finesse”</quote> and <quote>“the Majesty of Colouring”</quote> necessary to historical painting (Blake's kind)-an admission Blake
pounces on in Discourse IV (see marginalia on pp 89, go, 94., and especially
97).</p><p>     Keynes (p 908) speaks of <quote>“the notes on the other
volumes”</quote> as <quote>“being in the Note-Book with other
epigrams, etc., relating to events which took place about the year 1808”</quote>.  This derives from a note in Sampson's edition of Blake (p 318)
referring to verse epigrams, not prose notes, and inspired by Sampson's discovery
that two Notebook satires on page 33 constitute Blake's response to the concluding
words of Reynolds' fifteenth and last Discourse (1790, in Vol 2): <quote>“I should desire that the last words which I should pronounce in this

(for inspir'st), starlike (for star-like), and probably chear for cheer (though
Blake actually wrote <quote>“cheear”</quote>). He capitalized

the same materials and methods in painting as Cennini describes-particularly
the carpenter's glue”</quote>.  The book is devoted to materials and
methods throughout.</p><p>But Ellis was notoriously inaccurate.  Knowing

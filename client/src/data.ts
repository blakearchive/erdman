It was formed by Daniel\nPitti in the spring of 1997 using Arbortext.</p><p>The TEI dtds used are: tei.2, TEI.mixed, TEI.prose, TEI.verse, TEI.drama,\n TEI.transcr, TEI.figures, and TEI.linking.</p><p>All sgml files forming this document were verified using SGMLS.</p><p>All quotation marks have been replaced by entities.</p><p>All enjambed text in the printed volume has been formatted in continuous\nlines.</p><p>Ornamental horizontal rules in the print version are indicated by the empty\nTEI tag \"lb\" for line break, with a \"rend\" attribute having a value of \"hardrule.\"</p><p>The images exist as archived 300 dpi TIFF images, and as 300 and 100 dpi\n JPEG versions for general use.</p><p>Images have been made of text with unique and/or difficult to reproduce\n formatting.  This enables the preservation of the appearance of certain \nproblematic formatting.</p><p>The \"rend\" attribute has been applied liberally throughout the markup \nto reflect the orientation of certain text features as they appear in the\n print version. The most common values assigned to this attribute are  \"left,\"\n\"center,\" and \"right.\"  A value of \"1\" for this attribute signifies  that\na given line, stanza, or paragraph has been indented.</p><p>Three potentially concurrent structures exist within the print version:\nthe  logical structure of each component work (e.g., a poem, a letter, etc.);\n the physical structure of the print volume's pagination; and the  physical\nstructure of Blake's original pages and plates.  The markup of  each structure\nwill be described in turn.</p><p>The book's logical structures are indicated by the use of numbered  divisional\ntags.  Each logical grouping, or chapter, is marked as \"div1\",  and the subdivisions\nwithin each chapter (individual works) are marked as  divisions numbered 1\nthrough 3 as needed.  Front and back matter are marked  using unnumbered divisions.</p><p>The manuscript's pagination is indicated by the empty TEI tag \"pb\", or\n \"page break,\" to which the \"n\" or number attribute has been applied.  Although\n the page numbers appear on the bottom of each page in the print version,\nfor  ease of use online, the page numbers have been repositioned at the top\nof  each page.  Page content remains the same.</p><p>Blake's original plate or page structures are indicated by the empty TEI\n \"milestone\" tag.  The attributes \"unit,\" \"n,\" and \"rend\" have been added\nto  this tag.  The first attribute describes the discreet structure of  the\noriginal Blake artifact, be it a page or a plate. The second  indicates the\narchival number assigned to each unit: often, the value of  this attribute\nincludes both Erdman's archival number and any number etched  or penned on\nthe artifact by Blake.  The third attribute, \"rend,\" indicates  the palcement\nof the unit and number information on a given page in the print  version.\n In this context, the value of this attribute is usually either  \"left\" or\n\"inline.\"</p><p>Any editorial or authorial notes contained within the body of the text\n are indicated by the TEI \"note\" tag pair, which has a \"resp\" attribute  indicating\nthe person responsible for adding the note.  This attribute has  a value of\n\"ed\" if the remark was added by Erdman or \"auth\" if the remark  is Blake's.\n The latter value is used primarily within chapter 12, The  Marginalia.</p></editorialdecl><refsdecl><p>ID attributes are provided for each technical note.  Each ID is formed\nby  pairing the suffix \"TN\" with the unique identifying number assigned to\neach  note.  These unique numbers indicate the page number in the primary\ntext on  which the note marker appears, and its orientation among the notes\non that  page. For example, the fifth note on page 365 would have an ID of\n\"TN365.5\".</p><p>Within the primary text, each technical note marker indicated by a  superscript\nletter \"t\" in the print version has been replace with the  TEI tag \"xptr,\"\nwhich has a \"target\" attribute containing the ID value  defined above.</p><p>Within the end matter, each technical note is enclosed in TEI \"note\"  tags\nthat have an \"id\" attribute whose value is described above.</p></refsdecl></encodingdesc><profiledesc><creation><date>1965</date></creation></profiledesc></teiheader></div>"}, {"page_id": "", "headings": [["a1", []], ["a2", [["a2.1", []], ["a2.2", []], ["a2.3", []], ["a2.4", []], ["a2.5", []]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\"><p><hi rend=\"i\">  Note: The editors of the William Blake Archive believe that its digital version of Erdman's texts of Blake, which we first published in 2001, is a convenience to users.

Many of these deleted passages\nare printed here for the first time and allow us a comprehensive view of Blake\nas a reviser of his own poetry.  Readers and students of Blake, with this\ntext before them, confront an accurate and well-nigh complete collection--some\nerasures continue to defy transcription--of the writings of one of the greatest\nof English poets, and certainly one of the most original, and most relevant\nto us now.</p><p>The writings Blake issued in etched Illuminated Printing are given first,\nas the major canon of his Songs, Prophecies, and Tractates.  The unpublished\nlong poems follow, and then the lesser works, predominantly in verse, from\n <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Poetical Sketches</hi></title> to  <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Everlasting Gospel</hi></title>.  Lyrics that were omitted from\nthe illuminated canon are brought together as <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Songs\nand Ballads&#8221;</title>,  with a further group of <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Satiric\nVerses and Epigrams&#8221;</title>.   The late prose treatises are followed\nby the marginalia, other miscellaneous prose, and all of the letters. Verses\noccurring in the Reynolds marginalia and in the letters have not been disturbed.\n</p><p>Within these groups a rough chronology is observed, but only when thematic\nor generic relations fail to offer more meaningful groupings.  A definitive\nchronological sequence of Blake's writings is impossible from present knowledge.\n</p><p>Lines in the longer poems are here numbered by relatively small units,\nusually page or plate, since no standard numbering that suits a diplomatic\ntext has been established.  The numbering of plates for <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>, which varies in Chapter II, is that of the\nBritish Museum, Rinder, and Morgan copies.  The problem of there being two\nsections in the manuscript of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas\n</hi></title> titled &#8220;Night the Seventh&#8221; has been resolved with\nthe least injustice to the claims of narrative and the manuscript evidence\nby conflating them into one Night VII.</p><p>The Textual Notes at the end of the book are exhaustive for the poetry,\nand the designation of first, second, and later readings will permit reconstruction\nof first and subsequent drafts.

This revised and complete edition has involved\na thorough correction of every section of the text and an extensive revision\nof the Textual Notes.  Seventy letters added to section XV, making it now\nComplete, constitute the bulk of the new matter, though several small items\nhave been added to sections XIII (Inscriptions) and XIV (Miscellaneous Prose).\n Most of the corrections of text have been small, corrections of spelling\nand capitalization and of editorial bracketing or spacing.  Blake's eloquent\nuse of different colors in his hand-lettering of the Proverbs of Hell in copy\nH has been interpreted by differences in spacing the groups of proverbs. But\na device impossible to reproduce and explain simultaneously is Blake's etching\nof delete signs fitted to the tops of certain letters in a line in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Ghost of Abel</hi></title>, inviting the reader\nto read the line and immediately revise it. See the textual note.</p><p>     In the printings since 1965 there have been many corrections of readings\nof words; there are more here, such as <quote>&#8220;mossy&#8221;</quote>\ncorrected to <quote>&#8220;massy&#8221;</quote>, <quote>&#8220;garden&#8221;\n</quote> to <quote>&#8220;gardens&#8221;</quote>, <quote>&#8220;neatly&#8221;\n</quote> to <quote>&#8220;nobly&#8221;</quote>, <quote>&#8220;I heard&#8221;\n</quote> to <quote>&#8220;Heavd&#8221;</quote>.  Several mistakes in the deciphering\nof deleted passages have been corrected, the most striking being the correction,\nin the <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title> preface, of <quote>\n&#8220;entrusted their love to their Writing&#8221;</quote> to  <quote>&#8220;acknowledge\ntheir love to their Deities&#8221;</quote> and, toward the end of the Lavater\nmarginalia, of <quote>&#8220;they converse with the spirit of God&#8221;</quote>\nto  <quote>&#8220;these are either Good or Evil&#8221;</quote>.  The most\nimportant revisions are the rearranging of the early tractates, in accord\nwith Geoffrey Keynes's new evidence, including the moving of the <title level=\"a\">\n&#8220;Conclusion&#8221;</title> from one tract to another; the improved transcripts\nof <title level=\"a\">&#8220;My Spectre&#8221;</title> and  <title level=\"a\">\n&#8220;Sir Joshua Praises Michael Angelo&#8221;</title> and extensive revision\nof the apparatus of ms revisions of lines related to <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Infant\nSorrow&#8221;</title>; a rearrangement of Blake's Thornton marginalia, because\nof Robert N. Essick's discovery of the correct sequence of the loose pages\nof the Thornton book; and, of greatest importance, the drastic revision of\nthe text of pages 5, 6, and 7 of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas\n</hi></title> and the conflation of what were previously treated as separate\nNights VIIa and VIIb into a single Night the Seventh.

And evidence supplied by E.\nB. Murray and Mary Lynn Johnson has corrected the dating and identification\nof the letters here numbered 20 and 24.</p><p>     It was the collaboration with Donald K.

Blake simply left no instructions--to himself or to posterity--for\ntheir arrangement (we do not even know what order they were in when he gave\nthe ms to John Linnell).  Editors are left with the problem of choosing a\nsequence which will work best, in the context of the whole poem.  Neither\ntraditional arrangement, the relegating of VIIb to a postscript (as in the\nprevious Doubleday edition) or the printing of VIIa and VIIb in tandem (as\nin the Longman edition), is an adequate response to the manuscript or to the\nreader's appreciation of an inclusive yet coherent narrative or thematic sequence\nor structure.  The Textual Notes may be consulted for an explanation of the\nnew arrangement and for the other sequences suggested.  As for the work of\nrecovering the numerous and extensive palimpsest passages in that ms, the\ntechnology that may make that possible is emerging and hence the somewhat\ndistant promise of a still more complete text.  Meanwhile, of course, this\nnew printing will have its own fresh errors, which readers are urged to call\nto our attention.</p><p>     The design on our cover, constructed upon plate 64 of the Mellon copy\nof <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>, was inspired by our\neditorial respect for the Committee on Scholarly Editions (CSE).  The proofreader\nat the bottom with knuckles on text represents the five of us who, as required\nby the Committee <quote>&#8220;to prevent recontamination of the text,&#8221;\n</quote> will have been <quote>&#8220;scrupulously and repeatedly&#8221;</quote>\nproofreading during the course of this book's production.  Why that left hand\nheld to shield the text from the light shining from the inspired (but nodding)\nauthor, with quill on scroll beautifully unfolding to constitute a New Heaven?\nOur attention must be upon what the author wrote, not upon our vision of his\nvision, even though we keep watching.

Call thine alluring arts and\nhonest-seeming brow, the holy kiss of love, and the transparent tear; put\non fair linen, that with the lily vies, purple and silver; neglect thy hair,\nto seem more lovely in thy loose attire; put on thy country's pride, deceit;\nand eyes of love decked in mild sorrow, and sell thy Lord for gold.&#8221;&#8212;For\nnow, upon her sumptuous couch reclined, in gorgeous pride, she still intreats,\nand still she grasps his vigorous knees with her fair arms.&#8212;&#8220;Thou\nlov'st me not! thou'rt war, thou art not love! O foolish Dalila! O weak woman!\nit is death cloathed in flesh thou lovest, and thou hast been incircled in\nhis arms!&#8212;Alas, my Lord, what am I calling thee?  Thou art my God! \nTo thee I pour my tears for sacrifice morning and evening: My days are covered\nwith sorrow!  Shut up; darkened: By night I am deceived! Who says that thou\nwast born Of mortal kind?  Destruction was thy father, a lioness suckled thee,\nthy young hands tore human limbs, and gorged human flesh! Come hither, Death;\nart thou not Samson's servant?  'Tis Dalila that calls; thy master's wife;\nno, stay, and let thy master do the deed: one blow of that strong arm would\nease my pain; then should I lay at quiet, and have rest.  Pity forsook thee\nat thy birth!  O Dagon furious, and all ye gods of Palestine, withdraw your\nhand! I am but a weak woman.  Alas, I am wedded to your enemy!  I will go\nmad, and tear my crisped hair; I'll run about, and pierce the ears o'th' gods!\n O Samson, hold me not; thou lovest me not!  Look not upon me with those deathful\neyes!  Thou wouldst my death, and death approaches fast.&#8221;&#8212;Thus,\nin false tears, she bath'd his feet, and thus she day by day oppressed his\nsoul: he seemed a mountain, his brow among the clouds; she seemed a silver\nstream, his feet embracing.

Oil has falsely been supposed to give strength\nto colours: but a little consideration must shew the fallacy of this opinion.\n Oil will not drink or absorb colour enough to stand the test of very little\ntime and of the air.  It deadens every colour it is mixed with, at its first\nmixture, and in a little time becomes a yellow mask over all that it touches.\n Let the works of modern Artists since Rubens' time<milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"3\"/> witness the villany of some one at that time, who first\nbrought oil Painting into general opinion and practice: since which we have\nnever had a Picture painted, that could shew itself by the side of an earlier\nproduction.  Whether Rubens or Vandyke, or both, were guilty of this villany,\nis to be enquired in another work on Painting, and who first forged the silly\nstory and known falshood, about John of Bruges inventing oil colours: in the\nmean time let it be observed, that before Vandyke's time, and in his time\nall the genuine Pictures are on Plaster or Whiting grounds and none since.\n</p><p>  The two Pictures of Nelson and Pitt are compositions of a mythological\ncast, similar to those Apotheoses of Persian, Hindoo, and Egyptian Antiquity,\nwhich are still preserved on rude monuments, being copies from some stupendous\noriginals now lost or perhaps buried till</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "531", "headings": [["b8", [["b8.3", [["b8.3.3", [["b8.3.3.2", []], ["b8.3.3.3", []]]]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"531\"><p> some happier age.  The\nArtist having been <milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"4\"/> taken in vision\ninto the ancient republics, monarchies, and patriarchates of Asia, has seen\nthose wonderful originals called in the Sacred Scriptures the Cherubim, which\nwere sculptured and painted on walls of Temples, Towers, Cities, Palaces,\nand erected in the highly cultivated states of Egypt, Moab, Edom, Aram, among\nthe Rivers of Paradise, being originals from which the Greeks and Hetrurians\ncopied Hercules, Farnese, Venus of Medicis, Apollo Belvidere, and all the\ngrand works of ancient art.  They were executed in a very superior style to\nthose justly admired copies, being with their accompaniments terrific and\ngrand in the highest degree.  The Artist has endeavoured to emulate the grandeur\nof those seen in his vision, and to apply it to modern Heroes, on a smaller\nscale.</p><p>  No man can believe that either Homer's Mythology, or Ovid's, were the\nproduction of Greece, or of Latium; neither will any one<milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"5\"/> believe, that the Greek statues, as they are called, were\nthe invention of Greek Artists; perhaps the Torso is the only original work\nremaining; all the rest are evidently copies, though fine ones, from greater\nworks of the Asiatic Patriarchs. The Greek Muses are daughters of Mnemosyne,\nor Memory, and not of Inspiration or Imagination, therefore not authors of\nsuch sublime conceptions.  Those wonderful originals seen in my visions, were\nsome of them one hundred feet in height; some were painted as pictures, and\nsome carved as basso relievos, and some as groupes of statues, all containing\nmythological and recondite meaning, where more is meant than meets the eye.\n The Artist wishes it was now the fashion to make such monuments, and then\nhe should not doubt of having a national commission to execute these two Pictures\non a scale that is suitable to the grandeur of the nation, who is the parent\nof his heroes, in high <milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"6\"/> finished\nfresco, where the colours would be as pure and as permanent as precious stones\nthough the figures were one hundred feet in height.</p><p>  All Frescos are as high finished as miniatures or enamels, and they are\nknown to be unchangeable; but oil being a body itself, will drink or absorb\nvery little colour, and changing yellow, and at length brown, destroys every\ncolour it is mixed with, especially every delicate colour.  It turns every\npermanent white to a yellow and brown putty, and has compelled the use of\nthat destroyer of colour, white lead; which, when its protecting oil is evaporated,\nwill become lead again.  This is an awful things to say to oil Painters; they\nmay call it madness, but it is true.  All the genuine old little Pictures,\ncalled Cabinet Pictures, are in fresco and not in oil, Oil was not used except\nby blundering ignorance, till after Vandyke's time, but the art of fresco\npainting <milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"5\"/> being lost, oil became\na fetter to genius, and a dungeon to art.  But one convincing proof among\nmany others, that these assertions are true is, that real gold and silver\ncannot be used with oil, as they are in all the old pictures and in Mr. B.'s\nfrescos.</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "532", "headings": [["b8", [["b8.3", [["b8.3.3", [["b8.3.3.3", []]]]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"532\"><head id=\"b8.3.3.3\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-quaternary\">NUMBER III.</head><p><hi rend=\"i\">Sir Jeffery Chaucer and the nine and twenty Pilgrims on their\njourney to Canterbury</hi>.</p><p>THE time chosen is early morning, before sunrise, when the jolly company\nare just quitting the Tabarde Inn.

Fresco Painting is susceptible\nof higher finishing than  Drawing on Paper, or than any other method of Painting.\n But he  must have a strange organization of sight who does not prefer a \nDrawing on Paper to a Dawbing in Oil by the same master,  supposing both to\nbe done with equal care.</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "550", "headings": [["b8", [["b8.3", [["b8.3.3", [["b8.3.3.15", []], ["b8.3.3.16", []]]], ["b8.3.4", []]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"550\"><p>  The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life, is this: That the\nmore distinct, sharp, <milestone rend=\"inline\" unit=\"page\" n=\"64\"/> and wirey\nthe bounding line, the more perfect the work of art; and the less keen and\nsharp, the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism, and bungling.\n Great inventors, in all ages, knew this: Protogenes and Apelles knew each\nother by this line.

Whether you intended it or not, they have given\nme some excellent hints in engraving; his manner of working is what I shall\nendeavour to adopt in many points.  I have seen the elder M<hi rend=\"sup\">\nr</hi>. Walker.  He knew and admired without any preface my print of Romney,\nand when his daughter came in he gave the print into her hand without a word,\nand she immediately said, &#8220;Ah!  Romney! younger than I have known him, <hi rend=\"i\">but very like indeed.</hi>&#8221; M<hi rend=\"sup\">r</hi>. Walker\nshowed me Romney's first attempt at oil painting; it is a copy from a Dutch\npicture&#8212;Dutch boor smoking; on the back is written, &#8220;This was\nthe first attempt at oil painting by G. Romney.&#8221; He shew'd me also the\nlast performance of Romney.  It is of M<hi rend=\"sup\">r</hi>. Walker and family,\nthe draperies put in by somebody else.  It is a very excellent picture, but\nunfinished.  The figures as large as life, half length, Mr. W., three sons,\nand, I believe, two daughters, with maps, instruments, &amp;<hi rend=\"sup\">\nc</hi>.  Mr.  Walker also shew'd me a portrait of himself (W.), whole length,\non a canvas about two feet by one and a half; it is the first portrait Romney\never painted.  But above all, a picture of <hi rend=\"i\">Lear and Cordelia\n</hi>, when he awakes and knows her,&#8212;an incomparable production, which\nMr. W. bought for five shillings at a broker's shop; it is about five feet\nby four, and exquisite for expression; indeed, it is most pathetic; the heads\nof Lear and Cordelia can never be surpassed, and Kent and the other attendant\nare admirable; the picture is very highly finished.  Other things I saw of\nRomney's first works: two copies, perhaps from Borgognone, of battles; and\nMr. Walker promises to collect all he can of information for you.  I much\nadmired his mild and gentle benevolent manners; it seems as if all Romney's\nintimate friends were truly amiable and feeling like himself.</p><p>     I have also seen Alderman Boydel, who has promised to get the number\nand prices of all Romney's prints as you desired.  He has sent a Catalogue\nof all his Collection, and a Scheme of his Lottery; desires his compliments\nto you; says he laments your absence from London, as your advice would be\nacceptable at all times, but especially at the present.  He is very thin and</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "749", "headings": [["b15", [["b15.44", []], ["b15.45", []]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"749\"><p> decay'd, and but the shadow of what he was; so he is now a Shadow's\nShadow; but how can we expect a very stout man at eighty-five, which age he\ntells me he has now reached?  You would have been pleas'd to see his eyes\nlight up at the mention of your name.</p><p>     Mr. Flaxman agrees with me that somewhat more than outline is necessary\nto the execution of Romney's designs, because his merit is eminent in the\nart of massing his lights and shades.  I should propose to etch them in a\nrapid but firm manner, somewhat, perhaps, as I did the <hi rend=\"i\">Head of\nEuler</hi>; the price I receive for engraving Flaxman's outlines of <hi rend=\"i\">\nHomer</hi> is five guineas each.  I send the Domenichino, which is very neatly\ndone.  His merit was but little in light and shade; outline was his element,\nand yet these outlines give but a faint idea of the finished prints from his\nworks, several of the best of which I have.  I send also the French monuments,\nand inclose with them a catalogue of Bell's Gallery, and another of the Exhibition,\nwhich I have <hi rend=\"i\">not</hi> yet seen.  I mentioned the pictures from\nSterne to Mr. Walker; he says that there were several; one, a garden scene,\nwith Uncle Toby and Obadiah planting in the garden; but that of Lefevre's\nDeath he speaks of as incomparable, but cannot tell where it now is, as they\nwere scattered abroad, being disposed of by means of a raffle.  He supposes\nit is in Westmoreland; promises to make every inquiry about it.  Accept, also,\nof my thanks for Cowper's third volume, which I got, as you directed, of Mr.\n Johnson.  I have seen Mr. Rose; he looks, tho' not so well as I have seen\nhim, yet tolerably, considering the terrible storm he has been thro'! He says\nthat the last session was a severe labour; indeed it must be so to a man just\nout of so dreadful a fever.  I also thank you for your very beautiful little\npoem on the King's recovery; it is one of the prettiest things I ever read,\nand I hope the King will live to fulfil the prophecy and die in peace; but\nat present, poor man, I understand he is poorly indeed, and times threaten\nworse than ever.  I must now express my sorrow and my hopes for our good Miss\nPoole, and so take my leave for the present, with the joint love of my good\nwoman, who is still stiff-knee'd but well in other respects.</p><closer><salute rend=\"right\">I am, dear Sir,<lb/>Yours most sincerely,</salute><signed rend=\"right\">WILLIAM BLAKE</signed><signed rend=\"left\"><supplied>[From the\nGilchrist <hi rend=\"i\">Life</hi>]</supplied></signed></closer><head id=\"b15.45\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-primary\">45 <lb/><supplied>[To William Hayley]</supplied></head><opener><dateline rend=\"right\"><date><supplied>[28 May 1804]</supplied></date></dateline></opener><salute rend=\"left\">Dear Sir,</salute><p>     I thank you heartily for your kind offer of reading, &amp;c.

Mr. Phillips has sent a small poem; he would\nnot tell the author's name, but desired me to inclose it for you with Washington's <hi rend=\"i\">Life</hi>.</p><p>     Mr. Carr called on me, and I, as you desired, gave him a history of\nthe reviewing business as far as I am acquainted with it.  He desires me to\nexpress to you that he would heartily devote himself to the business in all\nits laborious parts, if you would take on you the direction; and he thinks\nit might be done with very little trouble to you.  He is now going to Russia;\nhopes that the negotiations for this business is not wholly at an end, but\nthat on his return he may still perform his best, as your assistant in it.\n I have delivered the letter to Mr. Edwards, who will give it immediately\nto Lady Hamilton. Mr. Walker I have again seen; he promises to collect numerous\nparticulars concerning Romney and send them to you; wonders he has not had\na line from you; desires me to assure you of his wish to give every information\nin his power.  Says that I shall have <hi rend=\"i\">Lear and Cordelia</hi>\nto copy if you desire it should be done; supposes that Romney was about eighteen\nwhen he painted it; it is therefore doubly interesting.  Mr. Walker is truly\nan amiable man; spoke of Mr. Green as the oldest friend of Romney, who knew\nmost concerning him of any one; lamented the little difference that subsisted\nbetween you, speaking of you both with great affection.  Mr. Flaxman has also\npromised to write all he knows or can collect concerning Romney, and send\nto you.  Mr. Sanders has promised to write to Mr. J. Romney immediately, desiring\nhim to give us liberty to copy any of his father's designs that Mr. Flaxman\nmay select for that purpose; doubts not at all of Mr. Romney's readiness to\nsend any of the cartoons to London you desire; if this can be done it will\nbe all that could be wished. I spoke to Mr. Flaxman about choosing out proper\nsubjects for our purpose; he has promised to do so.  I hope soon to send you\nFlaxman's advice upon this article.  When I repeated to Mr. Phillips your\nintention of taking the books you want from his shop, he made a reply to the\nfollowing purpose: &#8220;I shall be very proud to have Mr. Hayley's name\nin my books, but please to express to him my hope that he will consider me\nas the sincere friend of Mr. Johnson, who is (I have every reason to say)\nboth the most generous and honest man I ever knew, and with whose interest\nI should be so averse to interfere, that I should wish him to have the refusal\nfirst of anything before it should be offered to me, as I know the value of\nMr. Hayley's connexion too well to interfere between my best friend and him.&#8221;\n This Phillips spoke with real affection, and I know you will love him for\nit, and will also respect Johnson the more for such testimony; but to balance\nall this I must, in duty to my friend Seagrave, tell you that Mr. Rose repeated\nto me his great opinion of Mr. Johnson's integrity, while we were talking\nconcerning Seagrave's printing; it is but justice, therefore, to tell you\nthat I perceive a determination in the London booksellers to injure Seagrave\nin your opinion, if possible.</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "751", "headings": [["b15", [["b15.45", []]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"751\"><p> Johnson may be very honest and very\ngenerous, too, where his own interest is concerned; but I must say that he\nleaves no stone unturn'd to serve that interest, and often (I think) unfairly;\nhe always has taken care, when I have seen him, to rail against Seagrave,\nand I perceive that he does the same by Mr. Rose.  Mr Phillips took care to\nrepeat Johnson's railing to me, and to say that country printers could not\ndo anything of consequence. Luckily he found fault with the paper which Cowper's <hi rend=\"i\">Life</hi> is printed on, not knowing that it was furnish'd by Johnson.\n I let him run on so far as to say that it was scandalous and unfit forsuch\na work; here I cut him short by asking if he knew who furnish'd the paper.\n He answered: &#8220;I hope Mr. J. did not.&#8221; I assured him that he did,\nand here he left off, desiring me to tell you that the <hi rend=\"i\">Life of\nWashington</hi> was not put to press till the 3rd of this month (May), and\non the 13th he had deliver'd a dozen copies at Stationer's Hall, and by the\n16th five hundred were out.  This is swift work if literally true, but I am\nnot apt to believe literally what booksellers say; and on comparing <hi rend=\"i\">\nCowper</hi> with <hi rend=\"i\">Washington</hi>, must assert that, <hi rend=\"i\">\nexcept paper</hi> (which is Johnson's fault), <hi rend=\"i\">Cowper</hi> is\nfar the best, both as to type and printing. Pray look at <hi rend=\"i\">Washington\n</hi> as far as page 177, you will find that the type is smaller than from\n177 to 308, the whole middle of the book being printed with a larger and better\ntype than the two extremities; also it is carefully hot-pressed.  I say thus\nmuch, being urged thereto by Mr. Rose's observing some defects in Seagrave's\nwork, which I conceive were urged upon him by Johnson; and as to the time\nthe booksellers would take to execute any work, I need only refer to the little\njob which Mr. Johnson was to get done for our friend Dally.  He promised it\nin a fortnight, and it is now three months and is not yet completed. I could\nnot avoid saying thus much in justice to our good Seagrave, whose replies\nto Mr. Johnson's aggravating letters have been represented to Mr. Rose in\nan unfair light, as I have no doubt; because Mr. Johnson has, at times, written\nsuch letters to me as would have called for the sceptre of Agamemnon rather\nthan the tongue of Ulysses, and I will venture to give it as my settled opinion\nthat if you suffer yourself to be persuaded to print in London you will be\ncheated every way; but, however, as some little excuse, I must say that in\nLondon every calumny and falsehood utter'd against another of the same trade\nis thought fair play.

Under pretence of\nfair criticism and candour, the most wretched taste ever produced has been\nupheld for many, very many years: but now, I say, now its end is come. Such\nan artist as Fuseli is invulnerable, he needs not my defence; but I should\nbe ashamed not to set my hand and shoulder, and whole strength, against those\nwretches who, under pretence of criticism, use the dagger and the poison.</p><p>My criticism on this picture is as follows:</p><p>Mr. Fuseli's Count Ugolino is the father of sons of feeling and dignity,\nwho would not sit looking in their parent's face in the moment of his agony,\nbut would rather retire and die in secret, while they suffer him to indulge\nhis passionate and innocent grief, his innocent and venerable madness, and\ninsanity, and fury, and whatever paltry cold hearted critics cannot, because\nthey dare not, look upon.  Fuseli's Count Ugolino is a man of wonder and admiration,\nof resentment against man and devil, and of humilitation before God; prayer\nand parental affection fills the figure from head to foot.  The child in his\narms, whether boy or girl signifies not, (but the critic must be a fool who\nhas not read Dante, and who does not know a boy from a girl); I say, the child\nis as beautifully drawn as it is coloured&#8212;in both, inimitable! and the\neffect of the whole is truly sublime, on account of that very colouring which\nour critic calls black and heavy.

ERDMAN</head><lb rend=\"hardrule\"/><p>The acceptance of Blake's poetry as he printed it has been a very long\ntime coming.  No English poet has had such absolute control over the formal\nappearance of his own work, lettering, illustrating, printing, and finishing\nit in color with his own hands and usually with a particular customer in mind;\nyet few have had such ill fortune with their work's subsequent publication.\n Blake's nineteenth-century editors were poets or poetasters with their own\nideas of poetic diction and structure. Rossetti thought nothing of rounding\nout stanzas, remaking lines and titles, dressing Blake's naked beauty in Victorian\ngarb. Swinburne guessed his way through difficult passages or made the implicit\nexplicit--as when he <quote>&#8220;improved&#8221;</quote> the lyric called\n <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Soft Snow&#8221;</title> by changing <quote>&#8220;in\na snowy day/I askd&#8221;</quote> to <quote>&#8220;on a sunny day/I wooed&#8221;</quote>.  Ellis and Yeats substituted, for example, <quote>&#8220;shadowy\ntears&#8221;</quote> for <quote>&#8220;shuddering fears&#8221;</quote>, and\nthe latter thought it better to <quote>&#8220;throw the dust against the wind&#8221;</quote> than <quote>&#8220;the sand&#8221;</quote>&#8212;and so on.</p><p>     Rigorous editorial standards were finally applied, to the shorter\npoems, by the librarian John Sampson in 1905, who manfully cleared away the\nrubbish and many of the misreadings of <quote>&#8220;all editions&#8221;</quote>\nbut had only indirect access to the manuscripts; and to the prophetic books\nin 1926, by Professors Sloss and Wallis.  Sir Geoffrey Keynes's text of the\npoetry and prose, in successively revised editions from 1925 to 1957 and in\nvolumes with and without <quote>&#8220;all the variant readings&#8221;</quote>,\nestablished a still more accurate and more thorough text; and under his guidance\nthe Blake Trust has issued superb facsimile volumes.  Blake's designs (and\nwords) have, as he wished, remained unchanged <quote>&#8220;above Times troubled\nfountains&#8221;</quote>&#8212; and the Public is at last getting to see them.\n</p><p>The goal of the present edition is a text as close as possible to Blake's\nown, even in punctuation, and with his final or preferred readings separated\nfrom earlier or deleted or alternative readings or arrangements. (When Blake's\ndeletions have left gaps in the text, however, the deleted words have been\nrestored, in italics within square brackets.) Editing the works that Blake\netched and printed himself, but sometimes partially effaced and sometimes\nrearranged, requires precise transcription but also a recognition of Blake's\nown scribal errors and of the nature and limitations of his method.  For the\nfew works that survive only in conventional typography the editor's task is\nchiefly to correct, of course within brackets, printer's errors that range\nfrom the patent to the hypothetical.  For the many poems surviving only in\nmanuscript it is a matter of retracing as exactly as possible the successive\nstages of composition and revision and rearrangement, especially when no final\nor perfect draft is plainly discernible.</p><p>For this 1981 edition, several pairs of eyes reading proofs against\noriginals, photocopies, and facsimiles, have considerably increased the accuracy\nof transcription.</p><head id=\"z1.1\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-primary\">  THE PUNCTUATION</head><p>     A concise presentation of Blake's printed punctuation for the works\nin illuminated printing must acknowledge the frequent alternations introduced\nwhen he finished the designs with brush and pens.  But when the sequence of\nissue of copies can be determined, it appears that such variations in punctuation\nwere often not confirmed in subsequent copies.  Thus they do not indicate\nthat Blake consistently intended to alter the punctuation from that in the\nprinted texts</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "787", "headings": [["z1", [["z1.1", []], ["z1.2", []]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"787\"><p> before they were retouched.  For a collected edition&#8212;as\nagainst transcripts of individual copies&#8212;the printed punctuation thus\nappears to offer the best evidence of Blake's intentions.</p><p>     The hazards of the present editorial choice of Blake's own punctuation\nare minimal with respect to the lyric poems, of short lines and firm stanzas,\nfor here an editor's patching could mislead the reader more than omitted stopping.\n But the <quote>&#8220;long resounding&#8221;</quote> lines of Blake's epics\nand prophecies confront us with a problem to which there is no true parallel.\n When Blake omits nearly all punctuation, as he does in most manuscript pages\nand intermittently in etched ones, so much effort is required merely to follow\nthe prose sense, the syntax, of some passages that all of us are grateful\nfor the <quote>&#8220;bold attempt made&#8221;</quote> by Sir Geoffrey Keynes,\nwith the help of Max Plowman, <quote>&#8220;to supply punctuation, with the\nadmitted risk of sometimes conveying a meaning not intended by Blake&#8221;</quote> (Keynes 1957, p xiii).</p><p>     Unhappily, to supply punctuation means also to remove or change some\nof the punctuation found.  It means moving Blake's question marks to the ends\nof clauses, imposing a modern consistency on his semicolons and periods, adding\napostrophes where his possessives are truly ambiguous in number.  Blake is\nnot steady about punctuation, but when he does attend to it he does so in\nthe eighteenth-century rhetorical fashion: a dramatic passage is studded with\nwhat the modern journalist calls shriek-marks but which then served, <hi rend=\"i\">\nwithin the line</hi>, as italics do, for emphasis not pause. (In modern convention,\nKeats's line would be printed <quote>&#8220;Already with <hi rend=\"i\">thee\n</hi> tender is the night&#8221;</quote>.)  A solemn passage in Blake is retarded,\nnot halted, by strings of colons, or a slighter pausing is suggested by small\ndots after members of a series of nouns or adjectives (where we would expect\ncommas).  Often the dot is placed in some caesural point in the line but not\naccording to the grammar of clauses or phrases.  Good advice to the reader\nwould be to study some of these careful passages (many occur in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title>) and attend to Blake's differentiation of the <quote>&#8220;terrific&#8221;</quote> parts from the <quote>&#8220;mild &amp; gentle&#8221;</quote> and the <quote>&#8220;prosaic&#8221;</quote> (see <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>, Plate 3) even where he has not troubled to\nsupply any mechanical guidance for the <quote>&#8220;true Orator&#8221;</quote>\nwho was called upon to <quote>&#8220;chaunt&#8221;</quote> his <quote>&#8220;heroic\nVerse&#8221;</quote>.  Punctuation calculated to measure out the syntax of\nrational statement will almost inevitably divert both editor and reader from\nthe oratorical variety and musical impetus of the poet's authentic voice,\nonly to impose the bondage of <quote>&#8220;a Monotonous Cadence&#8221;</quote>\nfrom which he strove to be free.</p><p>     In print it is impossible to copy Blake exactly: his colons and shriek-marks\ngrade into each other; he compounds a comma with a question mark; his commas\nwith unmistakable tails thin down to unmistakable periods.  Moreover, one\nprinting from his etched plate may be more lightly inked than another and\nmiss out some apostrophes or reduce some commas to periods, some semicolons\nto colons or to commas or periods; when copies of the same plate vary, from\ndifferences of inking, the largest mark has been selected as closest to the\nmark in the copper.  In Blake the practical difference between comma and period,\nhowever, is almost unappreciable, and I have been inclined, especially in\nprose passages, to read commas or periods according to the contextual expectations\n(in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">An Island in the Moon</hi></title>, for\nexample). In some texts a few marks have been inserted, within square brackets.\n Only one kind of <hi rend=\"i\">silent</hi> insertion has been practised, where\nbrackets would be awkward: Blake nearly always supplied the apostrophe in\nthe possessive of Los (<quote>&#8220;Los's&#8221;</quote>, otherwise subject\nto confusion with <quote>&#8220;Loss&#8221;</quote>), and I have done so even\nwhere he did not.</p><p>The aim, in short, has been to produce a text which will mediate between\nthe reader and the manuscript or Illuminated Printing without introducing\na different pointing system.  In revising for the 1981 edition, I have produced\na sprinkling of corrections of punctuation, aided by many second looks and\nthe sharp eyes of other scholars.  I have also reduced the punctuation supplied\nwithin brackets to a lower minimum.</p><head id=\"z1.2\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-primary\">POEMS FROM MANUSCRIPT</head><p>     The poetical works that were never printed by or for Blake but survive\nin manuscript range from incomplete fragments and abandoned drafts (<title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Tiriel</hi></title> being the most extensive of these)\nto perfected lyrics that awaited only a place to be put among his illuminated\nworks (for example, some of the lyrics and ballads in <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The\nPickering Manuscript&#8221;</title>, a group of poems that was in a</p></div>"}, {"page_id": "788", "headings": [["z1", [["z1.2", []], ["z1.3", []], ["z1.4", []], ["z1.5", []], ["z1.6", []]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"788\"><p>sense\npublished by being written out fair for some unknown friend or patron).

Yet <quote>&#8220;exclusive&#8221;</quote> and <quote>&#8220;definitive&#8221;</quote> both need qualification.\n The disarray of the extant early tractates may signify that the author did\nnot wish to preserve them as units, while it would be a serious mistake on\nthe other hand to assume that Blake intended to exclude the lyrics of <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Pickering Manuscript&#8221;</title> since he did not\nillustrate them or to abandon <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas\n</hi></title> because he never etched it. Etching, however, did establish\na text that was definitive in the sense of fixed.  Once he had applied words\nto copper and etched surrounding surfaces away, Blake could not alter a letter\nexcept by laborious mending; he could scratch away words and even lines but\ncould not easily add new ones.  He called his plates <quote>&#8220;stereotypes&#8221;</quote> because on each he had made a piece of copper text and illustration\ninto a single solid for printing (and subsequent coloring).</p><p>     Blake was understandably reluctant to cancel whole plates, but that\ndoes not mean he regarded the making of a set of plates as the definitive\ncompletion of his poem; few of his <quote>&#8220;canonical&#8221;</quote>\nworks lack indications of the addition or removal of one or more plates. \nWith a more ductile medium he might well have forged a more perfect and more\ntruly definitive canon.  Yet he managed to make a virtue of the patchwork\neffects of his patching: a gallery of plates does not trap the observer as\nmight a serpentine closed circle of <quote>&#8220;fair copy&#8221;</quote>.\n Windows are left for the imagination, which may also leap from words to illustrations\nand back as one series supplements the other.  Blake sometimes composed in\nunits of one or two plates; if he had done so more often his shifting about\nof plates might have left fewer derailed paragraphs in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title> and <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>&#8212;but\nhe might then have done even more shifting.  Perhaps if he had been able to\nmake it so, each new copy of each of his works might have been in text as\nwell as coloring a new edition.</p><p>     He accepted the monolithic character of his pages, but he employed\nevery remaining means to keep his poems in motion&#8212;varying the color\nof his inks and his translucent and opaque tints and washes, and varying the\nsequence of his plates. It may not have been his particular consideration\nto make each copy of his <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Songs</hi></title>\nor of each of his Prophecies a unique work of art, although in effect that\nis what he did, but he was obviously pleased to make every plate of every\nwork a vehicle of fresh vision each time he touched it.</p><head id=\"z1.6.1\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-tertiary\">ALL RELIGIONS are ONE</head><head id=\"z1.6.1\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-tertiary\">THERE is NO NATURAL RELIGION [a, b]</head><note id=\"tn1.2\"/><p>     The titles and 26 (once 27) paragraphs of the axioms here grouped\ninto three series were printed from tiny etched plates (averaging about 2\nX 2 1/2 inches).

In no known copies (14 sets consisting of from 8 to 14 plates) is\nthe grouping of axioms complete or consistent, and the evidence for Blake's\nown arrangement of these subsequently scattered plates was not recognized\nuntil 1971, when Geoffrey Keynes in his notes for the Blake Trust facsimiles\nof the <title level=\"a\">&#8220;No Natural Religion&#8221;</title> series established\nthe authenticity of the order adopted here.

The earliest copies of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Songs of\nInnocence</hi></title> are complete and bear the etched date <quote>&#8220;1789&#8221;</quote> but may not have been issued that soon.  The lettering of the Innocence\nsongs is an improvement upon the stiff roman style of the earlier tractates,\nbut it continues the backward slant which was probably caused at first by\nBlake's using a mirror to guide his hand when writing directly on the copper.\n An exception is <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Voice of the Ancient Bard&#8221;\n</title> (later moved to the <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"m\">Songs of Experience\n</hi></title>), which is inscribed in a transitional cursive italic, with\nforward slant, a style also found in plates 1-5 of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nThe Book of Thel</hi></title>.  The lettering style that became Blake's final\nchoice appears first in plate 6 of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Thel</hi></title>\nand in all the Experience songs except those carried over from Innocence.\n In its first form it employs a lower-case <quote>&#8220;g&#8221;</quote>\nwith its topknot or serif switched to the left side.  Its second form employs\na conventional <quote>&#8220;g&#8221;</quote> with serif on the right and\nappears in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title>, dated <quote>&#8220;1804&#8221;</quote> and all later etched works. (The hypothesis long\naccepted that Blake applied the text of his Illuminated Works to the copper\nby some method of transfer or counterproofing&#8212;a theory that, however,\ncould not account for the text of the Books of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nAhania</hi></title> and <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Los</hi></title> which\nare in intaglio etching&#8212;has now been conclusively overthrown by Robert\nN.

Thus even while making his <quote>&#8220;1789&#8221;</quote> collection\nBlake was accumulating contrary songs, including  perhaps some not fit even\ntemporarily for Innocence.  Of the 18 songs of Experience in Blake's Notebook\n(in entries made between 1790 and late 1792) 12 seem fair copies of earlier\ndrafts (though subsequently revised or expanded) and only six were unmistakably\nbegun and composed in the Notebook, i.e., within these dates: <title level=\"a\">\n&#8220;The Lilly&#8221;</title>, <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Tyger&#8221;\n</title>, <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Human Abstract&#8221;</title>, <title level=\"a\">&#8220;A Little Boy Lost&#8221;</title>, <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The\nChimney Sweeper&#8221;</title>, and <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Fly&#8221;\n</title> (in that order).</p><p><title level=\"a\">&#8220;A Divine Image&#8221;\n</title> (given here following the <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Songs</hi></title>\nproper) was omitted by Blake from all but one known copy but must have been\netched before (and been replaced by) <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Human Abstract&#8221;\n</title>.</p><p>     Before the end of 1792 Blake had written among the Notebook\npoems a satiric <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Motto to the Songs of Innocence &amp;\nof Experience&#8221;</title> (see above, p 499); yet be advertised the two\ngroups as separate booklets on October 1O 1793, and his combined title page\nis etched <quote>&#8220;1794&#8221;</quote>.</p><p>     Songs not in the Notebook\ngroup and hence possibly of late composition are the <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Introduction&#8221;\n</title>, <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Ah!

Before confirming this alternative,\nhowever, Blake turned from the motifs of p 111&#8212;in which the priest laughs\nat the simplicity of wedlock (youth bound to mirtle tree)&#8212;to pluralize\nthe priest and serpent Of p 113.

There is only one possible\narrangement of the text, since it is organized into numbered chapters&#8212;except\nthat Plate 8, duplicating the numbers of Plate 10, may have been meant to\nreplace it (see below).  Yet Plate 2 is out of order in copy E, 15 follows\n18 in A, and 8 follows rather than precedes 10 in copies B and F.</p><p>The ten pictorial plates are in different positions in each copy.  Most\nof them more or less obviously relate to one or more passages in the text,\nhowever, and if we assume that the further the pictures have shifted away\nfrom their simplest textual referents the later the publication, we obtain\nthe sequence of copies CB F D E A    G, with A the climactic exemplar of the\noriginal series (it is not later than 1800 if the provenance is correct) and\nG (watermark date 1818) following at a distance. For instance, the picture\nof Urizen in manacles, appropriate to the text of Plate 13 (or 8 or 10), follow,\n13 in C and precedes it in B; in the more sophisticated A it is moved to the\nfront, as a portent of the end in the beginning.  Copy G imitates the majority\nof the earlier copies, with a few slight movements further away from juxtaposition\nof picture and text but without the expression of dramatic intensities found\nin A.</p><p>     Other evidence only partially supports this hypothetic sequence.\n Copy C, lacking the added Plates 7-8, may be the earliest copy; A and G,\nin which <quote>&#8220;First&#8221;</quote> is deleted in titles and colophon,\nare probably (G certainly) the latest.  Retouched letters in D and A are in\nthe style of Blake's middle period (1791-1803).  Copy B may be the first to\ncontain Plates 7-8, since it contains an attempt to cope with the intrusion\nof two Fourth Chapters which is abandoned as futile.  Seven leaves of B and\none of D have the only dated watermark (<quote>&#8220;1794&#8221;</quote>)\nexcept G. Yet the fact that Plate 16 appears only in copies ABG seems to mark\nit as a late insertion, hence to imply the sequence C FDE BA G.</p><p>   \n It should be noted that the page format and lettering of 7-8 differ markedly\nfrom those of the other pages but are like those of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nAhania</hi></title> and <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Los</hi></title>, the\nsecond and third <quote>&#8220;BOOKS&#8221;</quote> of the series, dated <quote>&#8220;1795&#8221;</quote>.

Possibly\nthe <quote>&#8220;1804&#8221;</quote> titles mark a division of the Grand\nPoem into two, a large epic and a small. Yet probably only the title pages,\nif even they, were etched at that time.  After his <quote>&#8220;1795&#8221;</quote> prophecies Blake may not have resumed his Illuminated Printing until\nafter his 1809 Exhibition of paintings.  In a letter of December 1808 he explains\nthat he has <quote>&#8220;long been turned out of&#8221;</quote> his <quote>&#8220;former pursuits of printing&#8221;</quote> (he has been asked what\netched books he has for sale) and that he will be preoccupied with painting\nand designing for some time to come.  In the <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nDescriptive Catalogue</hi></title> (section V) he repeats the hope for divine\naid to <quote>&#8220;publish&#8221;</quote> what he has <quote>&#8220;written&#8221;</quote> and seems to refer to <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>\nor <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas</hi></title> or both, a <quote>&#8220;voluminous&#8221;</quote> work.  The first epic be began to print and\nornament, however, was the smaller and more economically designed <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title> (on exact halves of the plates of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title> but inscribed so compactly as to contain nearly\nas maily words per page).  Only <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title>\nfits his description of <quote>&#8220;a Poem . . . which I will soon Publish&#8221;</quote> in the ms <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Public Address&#8221;</title> of\n1810 or later (see p 561).  His confident wording implies that the work was\nnearly finished, and the etching of all but three of the extant plates appears\nto have been done over a fairly short period: I suggest the years 1809-10.\n Although the paper of copies A and B is watermarked 1808, he cannot have\nused it in that year (considering his December statement) nor until the Exhibition\nwas launched in the following spring.</p><p>    When he etched <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title> he was content to write <quote>&#8220;Finis&#8221;</quote> on the 45th plate and in his first two <quote>&#8220;2&#8221;</quote>.\n Later, perhaps as he saw  copies to reduce the <quote>&#8220;12 Books&#8221;</quote> of his title page to <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>\nshaping into 100 plates, he went on to make <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nMilton</hi></title> an even 50. Most of the plates added in copies C and D\nappear to be filled with matter previously by-passed but to have been etched\nin the same period as the rest of the work.  Two exceptions are extra pages\n10 and 32, in a much lighter, freer style of lettering (with extra page 3\nleaning toward italic).  These I suspect to have been etched later than the\nrest, with copies C and D both completed near the time of printing of D (on\n1815 paper).  And in these late copies Blake, though keeping to two Books,\nwas proud to commemorate his original plan; not only did he let the numeral\nprint clearly <quote>&#8220;12&#8221;</quote>, he used careful stipple work\nto strengthen the shadow emphasizing each digit.  Students often suggest an\nexplanation: that Blake is comparing his work to Milton's 12 books of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Paradise Lost.</hi></title></p><p>     What relation\nthe extant <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title> bears to the\npoem first described in 1803 we cannot tell.  Many passages appear to be of\nrelatively late composition (Plates 6 and 4, for example); at least two, the\nPreface and Plate 19 (see note) belong in allusions and tone to the 1807-9\nperiod.  Yet the first added plate (3) is a refurbished passage from the <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Book of Urizen</hi></title> of 1794; the last added</p></note></div>"}, {"page_id": "807", "headings": [["z1", [["z1.6", [["z1.6.13", []]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"807\"><note id=\"tn95.1\"><p> plate (5) reads like a remnant of a version in which <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton</hi></title> had some of the character of such historical\nprophecies as <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">America;</hi></title> and two\nother added plates (10 and 16) seem early in relation to the main body of\nthe poem.

Then Plate 3 was inserted, borrowing the original\nlink, <quote>&#8220;woven by Enitharmons Looms&#8221;</quote>, which was then\ndeleted from 6:35-7:1 (see below).  After Plate 3 Blake then inserted another\nnew page, Plate 4 (syntactical link between 4 and 6: Blake's neighborhood\nresounded with engraving of animals [for the Hayley ballads], displaying naked\nbeauty and song, from Golgonooza in immense labours, ever building ever falling).\n Finally he brought in Plate 5&#8212;an earlier and perhaps rejected passage\nalso dealing with the creation of the classes.  The links now are difficult\nbut can be found.  If we recognize Palamabron with fiery harrow (5:1) as a\nFelpham variant of Blake-Los busy etching, his <quote>&#8220;returning From\nbreathing fields&#8221;</quote> can be taken as loosely in apposition to the <quote>&#8220;Mocking&#8221;</quote> and <quote>&#8220;Displaying&#8221;</quote>\nin 4:27-28.  And near the end of Plate 5, if we make a long parenthesis of <quote>&#8220;Charles . . . Living Proportion&#8221;</quote>, we may read: <quote>&#8220;Creating the Three Classes . . . From Golgonooza . . .&#8221;</quote>.\n</p><p>     To recover the narrative sequence from these accretions, Northrop\nFrye suggests reading the plates in the order 2, 7, 4, 6, 3, 8 (skipping 5).\n This is a useful suggestion&#8212;but does not represent (as Frye supposes) <quote>&#8220;the order of the `C' copy&#8221;</quote>.

Revisions\nat first made neatly over erasures or in the wide paragraph breaks maintain\nthis objective with a modified yet still elegant engraver's hand.  Further\nrevisions and additions, however, squeezed between lines and spilling into\nmargins, are in Blake's usual plain hand, as is all the text inscribed on\nthe blank spaces of the proof pages.</p><p>     Possibly a complete <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Vala</hi></title> in copperplate hand was produced\nbut lay unsold and open to revision which gradually reduced it to a working\nms.  On the other hand, it may be that the aim to keep each page in copperplate\nperfection was sustained through a decade or more of labor over the text and\ndrawings, a descent to ordinary hand on any given page occurring only when\nthat page</p></note></div>"}, {"page_id": "817", "headings": [["z1", [["z1.7", [["z1.7.3", []]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"817\"><note id=\"tn300.1\"><p>                                  became too cluttered\nwith revisions to be saved as perfect. (By this definition, pages 14-18, 26,\n33, 40 are unspoiled, and pages 24, 29, 38, 41 have changes suggested in pencil\nthat could still be perfected by careful erasure and inking: contrariwise,\nthe minor but effacing revisions on pages 19, 27, 29, 31, 37, 39 may mean\nthat Blake was giving up.) (See note on p 40, below.)</p><p>After Blake's\ndeath the ms was in loose sheets, but stitch- marks show he had once sewed\ntogether into one group all the sheets with elegant script and into another\ngroup those sheets containing pages 43-84 and 111-112, all in his usual hand.\nPossibly he thought of one group as finished, the other as preliminary, and\nany existing sheets not stitched as rejects (for example, Night VIIb, when\nhe thought of replacing it with VIIa).</p><p>At various stages of revision\nBlake counted his lines in each Night, sometimes by 100s, sometimes by 50s\nor 10s, and only pages 19-22, 87-90, and 111-116 lack numbering of any sort.\n But all Nights contain additions made after the latest counting.</p><p><hi rend=\"i\">Date:</hi> ca 1796-18O7? The <quote>&#8220;1797&#8221;</quote>\nin the title may mark the beginning of a first fair copy, while pages 141-142\nrepresent a fragment of a preliminary draft.  The work is named <title level=\"a\">\n&#8220;the Book of Vala&#8221;</title> in an early, erased stratum of page\n3; Bentley (p 177) suggests that it may have been <quote>&#8220;originally\norganized in `Books' as a continuation of&#8221;</quote><title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The First Book of Urizen,</hi></title> noting that borrowings from <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Urizen</hi></title> occur in Nights IV and V and that\nthese Nights are called <quote>&#8220;the Fourth Book&#8221;</quote> and <quote>&#8220;Book the Fifth&#8221;</quote> on pp 56 and 57.  Also to be noted is\nthe use of <quote>&#8220;Book&#8221;</quote> for <quote>&#8220;Night&#8221;</quote> in VIIb, p 95.  (But Margoliouth, p 121, argues that the use of <quote>&#8220;Book&#8221;</quote> is a sign of <quote>&#8220;very late&#8221;</quote>\nindifference&#8212;or <quote>&#8220;a deliberate, but abandoned, idea of giving\nup the `Nights'&#8221;</quote>.)</p><p>     It has been tempting to suppose\nthat successive layers of copperplate, modified copperplate, and usual hand\nrepresent successive and datable stages in the growth of the ms.  On this\nsupposition all the pages in usual hand should be later than those in copperplate&#8212;and\nall the latter should have fairly finished drawings.  But the drawings vary\nin finish throughout. And on certain copperplate pages a distinctly late style\nappears in the script, marked by the g which Blake adopted after Nov. 1802.\n On pages 8 and 10 this style appears in modified copperplate hand in revisions\nmade before clutter had set in; on page 12 the basic layer of text itself\nis in fine copperplate hand of this late character&#8212;and so is the chapter\nheading of <quote>&#8220;Night the Sixth&#8221;</quote> on page 67. (It should\nbe added that I have found no distinguishing marks of a pre-1803 script in\nany part of the ms, all the other g's being of the dateless, sans-serif variety:\nThe rule of <hi rend=\"i\">g</hi> may of course be less invariable than I have\nsupposed.  At any rate it is safer to conclude that the copperplate pages\nrange in inception from 1797 to 18O3 than to put them all in the later period.)\n</p><p>     Bentley has found that the sheet on which pages 48-49 were written\n(at the beginning of Night IV) bears evidence of prior use as a backing-sheet\nwhen Blake printed Hayley's first Ballad in May 18O2, but his argument (p\n195) that sheets marred or defective in some such way as this were the last\nones Blake would use should upset his assumption that none of the pages following\n49 were inscribed before that date.  As for the date of stitching of either\nof the groups described above, the second group includes the sheet with the\nMay 1802 impressions and so cannot have been stitched earlier than that; that\nneither group can have been stitched earlier than 1803 should be the deduction\nfrom the graphic evidence of late <hi rend=\"i\">g</hi>'s in the first strata\nof pages in both groups (12 and 67).  To suppose the other, unpierced pages\nnot to have been <hi rend=\"i\">written</hi> before 18O3 would shake all present\nassumptions.</p><p>    Even if an 18O3 date for the copying out of <quote>&#8220;Night the Sixth&#8221;</quote> is accepted, its composition may have\nbeen much earlier. On the other hand the date of 1804 or later which has been\naccepted for Night VIII on the basis of allusions to the renewal of war and\nof strikingly different symbolism or idiom from the main body of the poem\n(see Margoliouth, p 174) may need correction to <quote>&#8220;much later&#8221;</quote>.  The writing of VIII, at least, and the very late change of the\npoem's title to <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Four Zoas&#8221;</title> (a pencil\nrevision on the main title page not extended to the chapter headings) as well\nas a good deal of mending and revising, especially in Night I, must have occurred\nafter Blake had begun if not completed <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Milton\n</hi></title> and <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem.</hi></title> Bentley's\ncontention (p 165) that several passages were borrowed from <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem,</hi></title> rather than the other way round, is not convincing\nin respect to passages in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title>\n22 and 67-68, but the connections of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Vala,</hi></title>\n1, 21, 99 and <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Jerusalem</hi></title> 34[38]\nmay go in both directions.</p><p>     It should be recognized, however, that\nmany apparently late additions to <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">Vala</hi></title>\nturn out to have been salvaged from the erasure of early layers on the same\nor other pages.

Nevertheless certain salient historical allusions or sources\nremain, despite uncertainty as to how long after the event Blake wrote: negotiations\nconducted between Britain and France, in 1796 and 1797 (but again in 1800\nand 1801); the Netherlands expedition of 1799; Napoleon's coup d'&#233;tat\na few weeks later; the Peace of Amiens; its rupture.  Readers should also\nbe cautioned against inaccuracies and special pleading in Bentley's criticism\nof these groupings (pp 168-170)&#8212;and of course also against exaggerations\nin my subsequent critique of the Bentley volume (in an article in <title level=\"s\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Library</hi></title> for 1964).</p><p>Bentley's warning\nthat a second or third addition on one page may have no chronological relation\nwith a second or third addition on another is well taken&#8212;but frequently\nignored by all of us.

He is able\nto sort out pretty successfully those lines which were in the ms when Blake\ncounted and numbered his lines by fifties, but not to convince us that all\nthe counting took place at one time.

The top block of 9 added lines has been deleted, then restored\nby an ink circle, then heavily revised; the last of these (line 7 in the present\ntext) is so crossed out and mended that to restore it Blake has written <quote>&#8220;This line to come in&#8221;</quote> alongside.  The lower half of the\npage consists of original copperplate writing, with some mending and some\ndeletion of lines.  The undeleted original lines appear also on p 143 (a smaller\nleaf but neatly written as if begun as fair copy, perhaps of a draft preceding\nthe large copperplate pages) and are there revised.  Until recently it has\nbeen assumed that the revisions of p 143 were later than the final text of\np 7, but Andrew Lincoln argues convincingly that the final revisions on p\n7 are later than those on p 143.  In line 10, for instance, the <quote>&#8220;Half\nWoman &amp; half Spectre&#8221;</quote> was first half <quote>&#8220;Serpent&#8221;</quote> on p 7; On p 143 <quote>&#8220;Serpent&#8221;</quote> was first written\nand then replaced by <quote>&#8220;beast&#8221;</quote> but not by <quote>&#8220;Spectre&#8221;</quote> (which in the whole context must be the final\nterm); thus the final p 7 reading, <quote>&#8220;Spectre&#8221;</quote>, is\nlater than the p 143 revision.  In the evolution of serpent to beast to spectre,\nthe p 143 revisions constitute a middle or <quote>&#8220;beast&#8221;</quote>\nstage.  The changes from <quote>&#8220;scaly armour&#8221;</quote> to <quote>&#8220;rocky features&#8221;</quote>, from <quote>&#8220;lovely changing colours&#8221;</quote> to <quote>&#8220;darkly waving colours&#8221;</quote>, and from <quote>&#8220;monster&#8221;</quote> to <quote>&#8220;wonder&#8221;</quote> were\nthus temporary; in p 7 the Spectre reassumes the bright, scaly, monstrous\nquality of the Serpent.

Bentley\n(p 162) deduces that the sheet was used as backing when Blake printed the\nBallad and only later used as ms paper.  His further deduction or assertion\nthat <quote>&#8220;There is no evidence to suggest that any of the succeeding\npages [of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas</hi></title>] were transcribed <hi rend=\"i\">before</hi> page 48&#8221;</quote> is contradicted by his own argument\n(on pp 194-195 on <quote>&#8220;Anomalous pages <supplied>[i.e.  leaves]</supplied>&#8221;\n</quote>) to the effect that such imperfect leaves as this would have been\navoided by Blake until he reached the end of his supply of perfect leaves.\nThe discovery, in short, helps date pages 47-48, but it also seems to mark\nthem as a late insertion. (Bentley does not count 47-48 among the anomalies.\nHis categories consist of odd-sized leaves; <quote>&#8220;make-shift&#8221;</quote> leaves made of two overlapping pieces of paper but otherwise of good\nsize and good enough to have been used for <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nNight Thoughts</hi></title> proofs&#8212;for all the leaves under discussion\nare proofs made in 1796, with one possible exception, and available for ms\nuse any time thereafter; three sheets that were once folded together horizontally;\none with a small patch in the inner margin.

Presumably\nthe creases were made by the weight of the press and before ms use, or the\nwhole argument collapses; elsewhere Bentley is fairly confident that the writing <quote>\n&#8220;appears to be <hi rend=\"i\">on top of</hi> the printing&#8221;</quote>\n(p 162 n 1); he apparently also means us to connect the <quote>&#8220;creases&#8221;</quote> with the process which made <quote>&#8220;a regular indentation .\n. . where Blake's copperplate repeatedly pressed the paper&#8221;</quote>.\n These creases and indentation surely qualify the leaf for inclusion among\nsuch <quote>&#8220;anomalous&#8221;</quote> leaves as the three once folded;\nthe transferred printing would seem to put it rather further along the scale\ntoward the very imperfect end.</p><p>     Another kind of evidence that a\nsucceeding page was transcribed <hi rend=\"i\">before</hi> pages 47-48 is the\nstriking fact that p 57, the title of Night The Fifth, is so early it first\nread <quote>&#8220;Book&#8221;</quote> (<hi rend=\"i\">erased</hi> and written <quote>&#8220;Night&#8221;</quote>), while no such early wording occurs on the title\nof <quote>&#8220;Night The Fourth&#8221;</quote> on p 47.</p></note><note id=\"tn332.2\"><p>     13 Eternal] Anci<supplied>[ent]</supplied> 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn332.3\"><p>21 solemn] dismal 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg erased</hi></p></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"49\"/><note id=\"tn332.4\"><p>8 griding] dismal 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg erased</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn333.1\"><p>24 seeing] answerd 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"50\"/><note id=\"tn333.2\"><p>2 abhorrence] <hi rend=\"i\">followed by</hi> eternal <hi rend=\"i\">del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn333.3\"><p>5 dread] great 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn333.4\"><p>11] written over an apparently nonvariant draft of 12</p></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"51\"/><note id=\"tn334.1\"><p>4 dreary] dismal 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn334.2\"><p>7 solid] <hi rend=\"i\">mended from</hi> sold</p></note><note id=\"tn334.3\"><p>23 Vala] <hi rend=\"i\">mended from</hi> Valan   The six\noccurrences of such mending are on pages of rapid fair-copying; the mending\nis current and does not represent a change of name but a slip; perhaps from\nthe influence of other names of emanations, Enion, Enitharmon.

The text of VIIa, when first\ninscribed as fair copy from drafts not extant, ended at 85:22, fitting fairly\nwell the fair-copy opening of VIIb (91:1) but not smoothly.  From the nature\nof the fit it is reasonable to conjecture that 91-98 (VIIb) already existed.\nThese pages remain fair copy with minor revisions, but Blake achieved one\ndrastic revision by writing instructions to himself on pages 91, 95, and 98\nto begin <quote>&#8220;the Seventh Night&#8221;</quote> with 95:15 and move\nthe preceding passages (91:1 to 95:14) around to follow the end of 98&#8212;a\nchange which improved the fitting of VIIa to VIIb. (In either sequence VIIb\ncould bring the Night to a cadence, ready for Night VIII.) But later Blake\nerased the finish line after 85:22 and extended VIIa, first for a few lines,\nwith a new finis line, then, erasing that, to the bottom of the page and on\ninto the margins of picture page 86, originally a tailpiece for the Night;\nthen on through pages 87 and 90 (there being no room for text on pages 88-89).\n This new termination of the Night fitted VIIa very nicely to the beginning\nof Night VIII, but it left VIIb dangling. Blake might have thought to discard\nVIIb, but he did not do so; it contains passages needed in <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Four Zoas,</hi></title> somewhere. But their disposition remains\nan editorial problem, with no instructions from the author.</p><p>     Recently\nthree scholars, working independently, have come up with three proposed reading\nsequences, each more elegant than simply taking VIIa and VIIb consecutively.\n Andrew Lincoln, arguing from an impressive hypothetical reconstruction of\nthe evolution of the ms, would insert VIIa between the two portions of VIIb\n(as Blake rearranged them).  Mark Lefebvre and John Kilgore, arguing mainly\nfrom fit, propose inserting all of VIIb between the two portions of VIIa (taking\nthe first portion of VIIa as concluding with 85:22, originally followed by <quote>&#8220;End of the Seventh Night&#8221;</quote>).  Kilgore would return the\ntransposed parts of VIIb to their original order; Lefebvre would keep them\nin the order of Blake's transposing.  In the present edition I have decided\nto follow the latter course.

It should be noted that 90:1 is probably an addition, the text originally\nstarting within the platemark, and that 99:26-27 are an addition, which must\nbe treated parenthetically, made to round out the tale when the idea of bringing\nin the <quote>&#8220;Los stood . . . in the Gate of Luban&#8221;</quote> passage\nhad been abandoned; hence too the deletion of <quote>&#8220;at the Gate&#8221;</quote> in 99:25.</p></note></div>"}, {"page_id": "841", "headings": [["z1", [["z1.7", [["z1.7.3", [["z1.7.3.8", []]]]]]]]], "contents": "<div class=\"page\" id=\"841\"><note id=\"tn372.7\"><p>     1 recieving them] Los receiving <quote>&#8220;the dead&#8221;</quote> of 99:19</p></note><note id=\"tn372.8\"><p>11-13 Astonishd . . .  saw] Astonishd Comforted delighted\nthe daughters of Beulah saw 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.1\"><p>23 single] One fold 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.2\"><p>25] followed by nine lines marked for transfer to p\n101</p></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"101 FIRST PORTION\"/><note id=\"tn373.3\"><p>16 Upon the mighty Fiend] On the immortal fiend 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.4\"><p>20 brooding] <hi rend=\"i\">mended from</hi> broods</p></note><note id=\"tn373.5\"><p>27 among the Stars] his hurtling hand 1<hi rend=\"i\">\nst rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.6\"><p>28 His hurtling hand] Among the Stars 1<hi rend=\"i\">\nst rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.7\"><p>29] followed by instructions to transfer lines from\n100 and beginning of 101:</p><lg><l>But Urizen his mighty rage comes in here: to quenchless rage</l></lg></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"100 SECOND PORTION\"/><note id=\"tn373.8\"><p>26 But] But ?thus 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn373.9\"><p>27 round] from 1<hi rend=\"i\">st rdg del</hi></p></note><note id=\"tn374.1\"><p>33 Satan in dark Sanhedrim] probably suggested by Napoleon's\nsummoning in 1807 of the first Sanhedrin since the destruction of Jerusalem\nin A.D.70; considered by Blake's contemporaries as a millennial sign.</p></note><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"101 SECOND PORTI0N\"/><note id=\"tn374.2\"><p>31 repelld] Bentley still reads <quote>&#8220;expelld&#8221;</quote> (with query) but the <hi rend=\"i\">r</hi> is just like that in <quote>&#8220;rage&#8221;</quote> in the next line, and the <hi rend=\"i\">e</hi> cannot\npossibly be an <hi rend=\"i\">x,</hi> a wide and double letter in Blake's hand.\n (Nor would <quote>&#8220;expelld&#8221;</quote> make sense or fit Blake's\nusage.)</p></note><note id=\"tn374.3\"><p>33-37] written in margin without guide line; I follow\nKeynes in reading them as an addition to the transferred passage, belonging\nhere.

Perhaps his first intention was a six-line stanza;\nthe next eight lines are amplification, somewhat crowded in.  After p 33 he\nmight have used 44-45, but the next opening was ampler, with two open pages\n(48-49) and large blanks on 50-51 and smaller on 52-54. (As the poem took\nshape, Blake clustered his sections close together; if one argues for a late\ndate for <hi rend=\"i\">a b c</hi>, as truly <quote>&#8220;supplementary&#8221;</quote>, one must account for heir being written outside the Notebook when\nthere was ample rom for them on pp 44-45 and elsewhere.

The section concluded at first with\nlines 93-94, on p 52, and Blake counted up and inscribed his total as <quote>&#8220;94 lines&#8221;</quote>, later adding 95-96 in an adjacent column.\n Immediately below this total he wrote 2 1/2 lines, with an etcetera, meaning\nto bring in a passage from somewhere else (something written before the Notebook\nentries):</p><head id=\"z1.12.11\" rend=\"center\" class=\"heading-tertiary\">     [g]</head><milestone rend=\"left\" unit=\"page\" n=\"54\"/><lg><l>Seeing this False Christ In fury &amp; Passion</l><l>I made my Voice heard all over the Nation</l><l>What are those &amp;c</l></lg><p>We cannot reconstruct the <quote>&#8220;&amp;c&#8221;</quote> (though it\nmay possibly have been a variant of lines 11-14 of <hi rend=\"i\">c</hi>: <quote>&#8220;. . . what is Antichrist but those .  . .&#8221;</quote>).

The spacing of the ms lines of <hi rend=\"i\">e, f, i</hi> (and also <hi rend=\"i\">d</hi>) is about 4 to 4 1/2 to an inch, regardless of crowding, while <hi rend=\"i\">c</hi> and its revision <hi rend=\"i\">k</hi> are spaced about 5 1/2\nto 6 lines an inch.</p><p>     As the handwriting shrinks, the mending, revision, and rearrangement\nof lines increase.

But\nthen he decided to put <hi rend=\"i\">f</hi> (Chastity) after <hi rend=\"i\">\nk</hi> (Humility), cuing at the end of the latter section: <quote>&#8220;Was\nJesus Chaste or did he &amp;c&#8221;</quote>, and writing a title for the\npoem in at the head of <hi rend=\"i\">k</hi>: <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Everlasting\nGospel&#8221;</title>.</p><p>Then he squeezed in the prefatory merriment of <hi rend=\"i\">m</hi> and <hi rend=\"i\">n</hi>, probably in that order.  At about this point (in the book\nif not in time) he also wrote a wry comment (<hi rend=\"i\">l</hi>) on this\npoem of true Christ which the spirit of Joseph of Arimathea, via Blake's devilish\nor Spectre voice, was uttering.</p><p>     And then he stopped.  He did not mark the <quote>&#8220;Gentility&#8221;</quote> passage to come in, nor did he count its lines.  He did not assemble\nor mark the preface to come in.  It remains for editorial judgment to consider\nwhether <title level=\"a\">&#8220;The Everlasting Gospel&#8221;</title> should\nconsist of the Humility and Chastity sections alone, or whether to bring in\nthe Gentility, perhaps anti-climactically and the prefatory <hi rend=\"i\">\nm n</hi>, and the summary <hi rend=\"i\">e</hi> (at the end if anywhere): <hi rend=\"i\">m n, k f i, e</hi>.  It does seem plain that the early sections must\nbe thought of as abandoned rather than <quote>&#8220;additional&#8221;</quote>\nor <quote>&#8220;supplementary&#8221;</quote>.

The inclusion of <quote>&#8220;Chaucers Canterbury Pilgrims&#8221;</quote> as a second title rests on the conjecture that <quote>&#8220;it may\nwell belong to this essay, of which the engraving of <title level=\"m\"><hi rend=\"i\">The Canterbury Pilgrims</hi></title> is the ostensible subject&#8221;\n</quote>, as Keynes observes.  <quote>&#8220;It seems probable . . . that\nBlake was anticipating an announcement of the publication which he intended\nto work up from the raw materials&#8221;</quote> of these Notebook paragraphs.\n In the second paragraph Blake conceives of the work as an address <quote>&#8220;to The Chalcographic Society&#8221;</quote>.  Chalcographers (engravers\non copper) had formed such a Society in 1802.  Blake's old partner James Parker\nwas a leading officer in 1803; articles in the <title level=\"s\"><hi rend=\"i\">\nExaminer</hi></title> indicate its existence in 1810; Blake may have intended\nto address the group in 1810 on the plight of <title level=\"a\">&#8220;Engraving\nas an Art&#8221;</title>.
